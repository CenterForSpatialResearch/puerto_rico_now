*ISLA VERDE AS A LESSON; OCEAN PARK AS A COUNTER NARRATIVE* 

Puerto Rico, the Island of Enchantment, became a bit more enchanting to American investors after Governor Ricardo Rosselló announced 98% of Puerto Rico as an Opportunity Zone. The announcement came after The US Treasury Department and IRS defined Puerto Rico as an opportunity zone based upon the[US Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0341). Opportunity Zones are intended to foster investment in the *nation's* disadvantaged communities. Hurricane Maria's impact on the island fits the rhetoric of investment into low income communities, but whether they will substantialy aid needy communities is another question.

**Investment Island: PUERTO RICO NOW**

Key non-exhaustive list of incentives for American Investors in Puerto Rico. *It is our intention to demonstrate to Puerto Rico landowners the ease and reward of American Investment in Puerto Rico. It is imperative to note that the information provided on this webpage is to encourage landowners to understand the value of their land and therefore price it accordingly*    

1. Puerto Rico is a terretory of the United States. Americans do not need a passport to travel to Puerto Rico so traveling to and from the contiguious United States is hassle free. 
2. Puerto Rico's currency is the USD. Investments to Puerto Rico do not rely on a third party financial instituation for investments to be transferred. 
3. If you move to Puerto Rico you pay zero tax on capital gaines after you become a resident. 
4. Setting up a business on the island allows you to escape the 40% tax rate faced in California or New York. In Puerto Rico, your tax rate is 4%. 
5. Puerto Rico residents are not taxed in the United States on their Puerto Rico sourced income. 










Our investigation begins in *Isla Verde*, one of San Juan’s most tourism oriented neighborhoods. Adjacent to the San Juan airport, and full of US owned franchise hotels and businesses, this area most nearly fills the imaginary of a **resortified** Puerto Rico.  The Caribbean identity has given way to the monotonous copy-paste hotel architecture that can be found all around the world, just as minority of Puerto Rican businesses have been replaced by gated, palm tree lined branches of global hospitality giants.

To present and turn in your final projects for Conflict Urbanism: Puerto Rico Now you will be editing this template. You will include all of the text of your paper here, along with any and all images, maps, videos, or other materials that you produce.

[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.

See this is now a new paragraph.

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

![description of image](/puerto_rico_now/images/groupname/test2-.png)

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:


<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
