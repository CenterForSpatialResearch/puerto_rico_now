	<p>
	Sancocho, a traditional Puerto Rican stew composed of ordinary ingredients that magically transforms into a satisfying and nourishing meal. One can find bits of beef, carrots, plátanos, yucca and corn as it simmers in the caldero marrying the aromas brought forth by sofrito. While ingredients will vary based on availability, use of the Puerto Rican seasoning base is guaranteed. </p><br><br><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:16pt;"><b>1. Season Pieces of Beef. Dredge and Sear. </b></span>

<p>Sofrito is a Puerto Rican seasoning base made of garlic, cilantro, culantro, onions, and sweet peppers. One can find a pint in almost every mother’s refrigerator. Garlic is central to Puerto Rican cookery, and strangely none of it is grown on the island.</p><br><br>

<p>It is believed that the stew was born out of the African Diaspora. While slaves worked the fields of sugar or coffee plantations, a calderon of sancocho is to be seen simmering away for hours over a fire. Since beef pieces were the toughest pieces used it was important to have the stew cook until tender. <br><br>Puerto Rico is the oldest colony in the world. First conquered by the Spaniards, after years of neglect, Puerto Rican culture formed during this period. A mixture of Spaniards, Taínos and Africans. They were ready to govern themselves following the pattern of other Latin American countries who declared Independence. But, in 1898, the country was handed over at the request of the United States in the ______ treaty that ended the Spanish American War. Switching hands from one colonizer to the next. </p><br><br>

<p>Plátanos trace us back to African roots. Yucca traces us back to Taíno roots. Indigenous ingredients, originally cultivated on the land. Soon after the U.S. take over, there was a push for an increase in sugar and coffee.</p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:16pt;"><b>5. Add Corn. Simmer</b></span>

<p>Non Government Organizations are organizing to undue the political and historical process that has made Puerto Rico dependent on food importation. More than 85% of foods are brought from outside countries. In 2016 _________ was spent on foods that could have been grown on the island. While it is unclear if Puerto Rico can produce all its food, NGOS are working hard to decrease this dependence. This is money that could have been spent on the local economy<br><br>NGOS are focusing on agroecology principles to reverse damages taht have been done and reliance on corporations for inputs.<br><br>Sancocho is a dish that does not cost much to make but can feed many. Chances are you’ll find it at welcome parties, birthday parties, dinner parties, community events, and sometimes even after a brutal storm.</p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:16pt;"><b>How many Countries does it take to make Sancocho?</b></span>
<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/Imports-GIF.gif"><br><br>
<p>It takes 22 countries to produce a commonly made stew on the island. Locating this data was challenging for a number of reasons. Data was aggregated therefore miles traveled a more considering the requirement of the Jones Act. All these food would have had to stop on the US mainland before being shipped to the island. Along with these ingredients some other major foods that are also imported include ______. Many NGOs are working to reverse this and are working towards a Food Sovereign Puerto Rico where small farmers and local producers are leaders.</p><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:16pt;"><b>Can Food Sovereignty be achieved without Political Sovereignty?
</b></span><br><br>
<p>“Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It puts the aspirations and needs of those who produce, distribute and consume food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations.” – Declaration of Nyéléni, the first global forum on food sovereignty, Mali, 2007<br><br>As of today Puerto Rico is still a colony and is politically limited. They cannot vote on policies yet a severely impacted by it. </p><br><br>

<p>Agroecology farming is a key component in Food Sovereignty. An alternative model to current industrial farming, where small farmers Agroecology is concerned with where food comes from, how it is produced, who produces it and how knowledge and skills around food and agriculture are shared. It accompanies this understanding of food and agricultural production with a social, cultural and political context – drawing a picture of our different agricultures, and celebrating their diversity. It provides a holistic understanding of our place in natural cycles and how our farming systems must adapt to and enhance the ecosystems and societies they depend on.</p>
