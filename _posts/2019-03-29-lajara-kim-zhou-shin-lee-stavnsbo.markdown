title:  "Migration Journies: Origins, Memory, & Spatial Inequality"
author: "Isabella Lajara, Isaac Kim, Chenyan Zhou, Sanggyu Shin, Jinsook Lee, Simone Stavnsbo"
---
The Puerto Rican exodus refers to the massive wave of migration from Puerto Rico to the US mainland following Hurricane Maria. While migration from the island is a constant fact of life for Puerto Ricans, the hurricane brought a new urgency to an already pressing migration crisis.

Many Puerto Ricans migrated to the U.S. temporarily during and after the hurricane. Some settled more permanently while others chose to return to Puerto Rico, even if the conditions were not yet back to pre-hurricane standards.

The dominating narratives surrounding the migration focus on integration of the increased Puerto Rican diaspora on the one hand and the economic and social context of Puerto Rico on the other. Migration is often thought of as a clear-cut, linear process, with a point of origin and a destination, with an analytical emphasis on the destination. Few have studied the actual migration journey -- that is why individuals leave, and furthermore, why they sometimes return.

This is the central question of our project - examining why some people migrate temporarily and others permanently, taking our point of departure in the origins of migrants not the destination.

Spatial inequality is one of the factors informing migration journeys. Not only the spatial inequality between the U.S. mainland and the island, but also internally in Puerto Rico. Urban areas are often much more affluent, have better infrastructure and better access to essential services compared to rural areas. Cities, in particular the capital San Juan, have been able to bounce back from the hurricane faster and better than rural areas. The demographic divide is also startling -- poverty is more prevalent in rural areas, and few working class people can afford to live in urban areas.

In effect, this means that a migration from a underserviced, rural area in Puerto Rico to the U.S. mainland is a very different experience than migrating from urban Puerto Rico. We propose that this difference can be a determining factor when people decide to migrate permanently or temporarily -- people from rural Puerto Rico are more likely to migrate permanently.

In order to support our thesis, we decided to gather our data through interviews, a process that has allowed us to put a face to the migration stories. Through nine case studies of people of varying ages, socioeconomic statuses, differing neighborhoods, and personal connections to migration out of Puerto Rico, we were able to compare and contrast migration stories to create a narrative surrounding the importance of the place of origin in migration journeys. Seven of our cases are based on our own interviews, while two (Eunice and Juanyri) are interviews found online, both from the Miami Herald.

What we found is our case studies from more urban areas tended to have greater financial resources that allowed them to return to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Those in rural areas with lower financial resources cited the crumbling economy as a reason for their migration away from Puerto Rico being permanent. A common factor that affected all our case studies was the presence of strong familial ties, that kept firm connections to Puerto Rico, driving some with greater financial resources to stay on the island.

#### FEO & LINDA

Feo and Linda, the oldest of our case studies at seventy five and seventy two, respectfully, are from the rural Guaynabo. Our thesis examines why some people migrate temporarily and others permanently, so we interviewed the older Feo and Linda about their migratory experiences. Coming from a more rural working class area and being retired, we expected Feo and Linda to not want to migrate from Puerto Rico, or at least not want to migrate permanently, due to their age. This was confirmed by Feo and Linda who cited their reason for returning to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria to their family who still reside in Guaynabo. With their older age and retired status, they did not want to leave their home that holds so much history and sentimental value. Furthermore, they are not searching for jobs in Puerto Rico’s crumbling economy, and are thus less affected by their rural context than others we have interviewed.

The economy was a theme throughout our case studies. In three of the case studies, Dilberto, Francheska and Nilsa, chose to permanently migrate out of Puerto Rico because of the economy. All three of them cited the lack of job opportunities before Hurricane Maria as causing them to consider migrating to the United States. All three are friends from Villalba, a rural area of Puerto Rico, and are in their mid to late twenties. With the greater Puerto Rican economy being focused in urban areas like San Juan, these migration considerations were solidified after Maria and the foreclosing of many businesses in the rural areas that lead to a significantly smaller job market.

#### NILSA

![description of image](/puerto_rico_now/images/migration/Timeline_Final-01.jpg)

Nilsa, who gained her bachelors in culinary arts from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, was frustrated at the lack of jobs in the culinary field, a field she had dedicated four years to. She has migrated to Lancaster, Pennsylvania where she works as a saleswoman to financially support herself and her two children. She cited the lack of resources after the hurricane as a determining factor in her permanent migration to Lancaster. While Lancaster is very different from Villalba spatially, she felt it provided the best future for her career and for her two young children's education. She still misses the waterfalls in Villalba and the empanadillas she used to get from Collores, but she knows her decision to leave was her only option in achieving a higher quality of life.   

#### FRANCHESKA

Francheska, similarly studied at Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, where she majored in English but was unable to finish her degree due to Hurricane Maria. She further mentioned how many of her classmates and even some professors did not return to Puerto Rico following the hurricane. The few educational opportunities and lack of financial aid made her uncertain of the job security in Puerto Rico upon completing her diploma, if she could complete it without aid. This, coupled with the stress of providing her six year old son a stable future, caused her to permanently migrate to Buffalo, New York, where she is now completing her English degree at the University of Buffalo. She believes that the job market in Buffalo after she finishes her degree will allow her to provide a greater financial stability to her son, who’s school closed after Hurricane Maria. She, like Nilsa, believes that her permanent migration was the only option in ensuring her son received the best possible education she could provide and the most financially stable option for her.

#### DILBERTO

Dilberto was unemployed in Puerto Rico, and given the high expenses associated with life in post-hurricane Puerto Rico affected his ability to stay on the island. At the suggestion of his friend Francheska, he also moved to Buffalo. In Buffalo, he was able to gain employment as a factory worker, something he hopes will allow him to assist his grandparents in moving to the U.S., since their house was severely damaged by the hurricane. While he misses Puerto Rico’s warmth, he left to look for better opportunities for himself and his family. He stated that the growing migration posed a problem for the country’s survival, since the high cost of living, given the lack of resources available, impacts everyone on the island. He found it difficult to find job opportunities with a fair wage, causing him to migrate to Buffalo permanently for the chance to earn more and also send money back to his family. Since he does not see a significant enough change to Puerto Rico, he sees no need to return, despite his love for the island. He admits that Caonillas, the neighborhood he grew up in, is very different from Buffalo, but believes that the day he can bring his grandparents to live with him, instead of in the affected home they currently reside in, his migration would have been worth it.

#### FINDINGS

All three of the above mentioned case studies were already college educated, or receiving a college education. However, the lack of job opportunities they met before the hurricane, which was only exasperated further after the hurricane, caused them to migrate permanently out of Puerto Rico, searching for a higher quality of life.

While Francheska, Nilsa and Dilberto were already college educated, our next three case studies, Laurel, Amanda and Mariettani were not. When Hurricane Maria hit, the three girls were only high school juniors or seniors, relying on their parents for financial and emotional support. Their experiences with migration, whether temporary or permanent, was decided upon by their parents in the hopes that they could provide their school aged children with better educational futures.

#### LAUREL

For Laurel, who self identified as upper class, her temporary migration from Dorado, Puerto Rico, a suburban area to urban Miami, Florida, was to ensure her parents would still be able to work. They moved back to Dorado a week after the hurricane. She however had decided to study at Boston University, far from Puerto Rico, for the chance to find work after she graduated. She felt that the few universities in Puerto Rico that remained open after the hurricane would be unable to provide her the education needed to find a post-graduate job. She stated that other families most likely left for work or were worried about how the island would fare after the hurricane, especially if they came from more rural parts, which because of the lack of electricity, clean water and medicine were more dangerous areas to be in post hurricane. She believes that if her parents weren’t financially capable of staying in Puerto Rico and providing her and her family with a stable future, they also would have permanently migrated to the United States or another country that houses other members of their family.

#### AMANDA

Amanda, similarly identified as upper middle class and from the urban area of Hato Rey, San Juan, temporarily migrated to Queen, New York three weeks after the hurricane, since there was no way of getting out of the island beforehand. She cited that the biggest reason her family wanted to leave was because she was scheduled to take the SATs the weekend of the hurricane, which was her last chance before applying early decision to colleges. Despite having no cell service or open schools that could house the SATs, universities still expected her to apply on time. She also cited that her family could not leave before the hurricane hit since flights were costing around $1,500 per person up to two days before the hurricane impacted the island, a price her family could not afford to pay for each individual member. She and her family returned three weeks later to keep Amanda in school. While in school, she submitted her college applications on the side of the street that provided the only internet hotspot. She only had half days at school until the schools received enough electricity to hold full working days. She is now a freshman at Columbia and like Laurel, does not see herself returning to Puerto Rico when she graduates and cites the lack of a job market and the crumbling economy as the reason why.

#### MARIETTANI

Mariettani, while the same age as Laurel and Amanda, and looking for similar educational opportunities, is from a lower socioeconomic status and a more rural area of Puerto Rico. Hailing from Guaynabo, Mariettani now resides in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to finish her schooling. She cites the reason for her permanent migration as the need to finish her senior year of high school. She was unable to do this in Puerto Rico because the school was destroyed by the hurricane and thus classes were suspended as the government was incapable of funding the rebuilding. With the closure of more and more high schools due to lack of water for bathrooms, financial help for cafeterias, electricity for classrooms and other infrastructural problems, her family felt forced to move to the Dominican Republic. Due to their working class socioeconomic status, her family could not afford to relocate to the United States, like Laurel and Amanda’s family had. Instead they moved to the Dominican Republic, another nation on an island with a poor economy, but more robust in comparison to Puerto Rico post Maria. Mariettani explained that she wanted to return to Puerto Rico after she finished high school but having to think about her future, she decided to stay in Santo Domingo to start college, despite missing her family. She cites her need for an education and financial stability after she graduated as her cause for not returning.     

#### EUNICE

Eunice is the grandmother and primary caretaker of three girls. One of her granddaughters, Anabel, has autism and was prior to the hurricane enrolled in a local primary school. The school provided an aide for Anabel so she could be enrolled in a regular school rather than a special need school. After the hurricane, all schools closed indefinitely until further notice. In order for Anabel to continue having her aide and schooling, Eunice decided to temporarily move to Miami, Florida, where these resources were still available. A year later, however, the government was able to guarantee that if they were to return, Anabel would have access to her pre-hurricane services again. In fact, Anabel would be able to return to the same primary school as she had previously attended. Because of this, Eunice decided to move back, as their situation would be the same as pre-hurricane. There was little advantage in staying in Miami.

#### JOANYRI

Joanyri was a english teacher at a local school in Arecibo. Following the hurricane, the local tap water had been contaminated and Joanyri became ill. Many hospitals were closed, and in order to receive treatment Joanyri had to first find fuel to be able to transport herself to a place with cell reception to then be able to seek treatment. Following this ordeal, and given the fact that her workplace was closed and her water supply contaminated, she decides to move to Miami. In Miami, it was much easier for her to access medical aide. She was quickly able to find a job at a local school, as there is a much larger demand for teachers in Florida compared to Puerto Rico. Not only are there more job opportunities in the U.S., but the jobs are also often better recompensed than in Puerto Rico. Despite her daughter and fiance in Puerto Rico, Joanyri decided to stay permanently in Miami because of the stability of medical services and employment opportunities.

#### FINDINGS & CONCLUSIONS

The data collected through our interviews support our thesis, as all the interviewees from rural areas have indeed decided not to return to Puerto Rico, but migrate permanently, with the exception of Feo and Linda. Feo and Linda, as mentioned above, present an usual case, as they are less affected by the factors causing many other rural people to permanently migrate. The families of interviewees from urban areas have all returned to Puerto Rico, leaving behind their college-aged children who are pursuing further education outside of the island, with the knowledge that the post graduation job market  in Puerto Rico will most likely not have opportunities for them. However, these young people would likely have gone to the U.S. to pursue higher education regardless of the hurricane, with the exception of Mariettani, who could not afford to migrate to the U.S. , but was able to attend university in the Dominican Republic instead.

All of the returning families have framed their decision as being “for the family”. Returning to Puerto Rico allows them to stay close to extended family. The families that are not returning also underlined their motivation as being “for the family”. In this case, a departure from Puerto Rico allows them to provide for their family in ways that they could not on the island after the hurricane. In fact, their departure allows them to provide in ways that they couldn’t have even before the hurricane. Especially regarding future opportunities for their children, which was often cited as being a main motivation for the migration.

This is represented spatially and socioeconomically, with case studies from rural areas being left with few other options but permanent migration, especially if they were working class with no employment opportunities on the island. Those from more suburban and urban areas with a higher socioeconomic status, found themselves with the luxury of being able to choose freely to migrate permanently or return to Puerto Rico post hurricane. Many families moved back without their college aged children, who migrated in the hopes of receiving a better education than what was possible in Puerto Rico.

Attachment [images of empanadas, waterfalls and homes]
After speaking to our seven interviewees, an apparent theme is the sense of attachment to Puerto Rico. Despite making active choices to migrate, whether permanently or temporarily, they all shared a sentimental connection to their homelands and communities. These memories are especially painful for those who feel they cannot return to Puerto Rico. People like Francheska cited missing familiar faces waving hello to her and her son and Dilberto misses the easy access he had to family members, often just a drive up the street. Even those whose families returned to Puerto Rico miss places that previously held sentimental value but were destroyed by the hurricane. Laurel’s connection to Condado, where she went to school and spent weekends with friends, felt severed due to the amount of damage. She said, “it doesn’t even feel like home.” Nilsa, who moved thousands of miles away from the warm Island of Puerto Rico to the colder Pennsylvania, misses the empanadillas and waterfalls that were part of her childhood. For those not too far away, like Mariettani and Feo and Linda, who went to the Dominican Republic and Florida, where the physical distance is smaller than in Nilsa’s case, memories of the home they once knew are forever altered having seen the damage done to neighboring homes and schools.
