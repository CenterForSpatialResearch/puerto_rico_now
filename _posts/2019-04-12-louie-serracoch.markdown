#### **Why is it relevant?**
Following the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in September 2017, Puerto Rico’s electrical grid failed, water systems were inoperable, debris from landslides blocked roads, cellular sites were knocked out, and households were damaged, among the numerous other challenges (FEMA, 2019). This natural disaster put Puerto Rico in the spotlight for relief, but the U.S. territory had already been struggling with a debt crisis as a consequence of limited sovereignty and a complex colonial relationship with the United States. The prolonged inability to recover infrastructural services after the hurricane revealed the communities’ compounded vulnerability from the economic crisis. Although FEMA plans to provide $2.36 billion dollars in assistance to survivors on the island (FEMA, 2019), after relief aid has run out Puerto Rican communities will continue to face challenges with economic recovery. Allocated recovery resources often reflect the values of the decision makers in power. The political priorities will drive decisions that affect whom they serve, how funds are distributed, and where recovery resources are allocated on the island, potentially shaping different futures for Puerto Rico.

#### **The Decision Model**
Planning methodologies, such as the decision model, attempt to ensure consistency and fairness, in which “all stakeholders and values weigh in toward making the best decisions, and applying them to the right places” (Campanella, 2005). With a variety of factors that need to be considered in Puerto Rico’s recovery funding allocation, decision analysis systems can be great “tools to augment, enable, or automate the decision-making process... where decision making is complex and/or requires several forms of input information.” (Meisterlin, 2017). Geographic Information Systems (GIS) enables these decisions by evaluating the spatial relationships between layers of information, in which priorities can be weighted to influence a variety of outcomes. 

However, because this methodology relies on mathematics, it implies that the process and data are “all we need for objectivity and objectivity may be all we need for fairness” (Meisterlin and Newman). Despite the logical method, data is biased and weighted priorities can inform different outcomes, and this becomes problematic when only people in positions of power have access to this knowledge. If we can teach community members how to read between the lines of these maps, we can give them greater agency in promoting their own priorities. Our goal is to empower communities to use the decision model as a participatory tool for advocacy and negotiation. 

**Project Process**
We will create three decision models that respond to the priorities of different stakeholder interests. Depending on how each of their priorities in spatial layers are weighed, the decision model will produce different potential future scenarios. Our aim is twofold; we want to reveal how decision models are highly dependent on their priorities and to empower agency to communities by educating them on how to use these maps to negotiate their interests. Furthermore, the decision models will be published as an interactive web-based mapping tool to allow participants to form their own position on what areas in Puerto Rico should be prioritized for recovery efforts.

**“Conflicting” Interests**
To explore different priorities, three archetypal groups of stakeholders will represent the potentially conflicting interests for the future of Puerto Rico. Although fictional and exaggerated, the characterization of stakeholder groups is useful to illustrate how differences in priorities affect the final decision output.

#### **What are the results?**
We will create the three different decision models and the maps that reflect the potential scenarios they reveal. This phase will include:
- The data collection
- The characterization of the three groups of stakeholders and their priorities
- The design of the three different models with their set of rules
- The production of the three different future scenarios represented by maps

#### **Why are we doing it?**
Our final aim is broadening the discussion on expertise and agency by sharing bringing knowledge and methodologies originally connected with “professionals” and “experts” to the community. The idea is to share the methodology instead of the final product to allow for replication, challenging of the underlying decision rules and better understanding how future scenarios depend on the priorities set up by different stakeholders.
