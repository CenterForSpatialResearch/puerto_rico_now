This project focuses on the study of how predatory lending practices and failing infrastructure have caused the quality of living in Puerto Rico to decline especially within the island's geriatric community. By targeting individuals with finite incomes, companies were able to sell reverse mortgage loans to elderly Puerto Rican home owners aged 62 and older. These loans contained requirements that were unclear or undisclosed to the people who signed them and have been correlated with the increase in the foreclosure and delinquency rate in Post-Maria Puerto Rico. 
While researching the quality of life amongst Puerto Rico's elderly, it became apparent that enumerating the stressors on the quality of life may be beneficial. They are as follows: 

1. *Failures of Infrastructure-* transportation, public health, electricity, and clean water
1. *Uncertainty Around Reverse Mortgages-* unsafe housing situations, misunderstanding requirements of the loan, need to relocate
1. *Higher Occurence of Deaths-* higher likelihood to die during hurricanes, fight to have deaths correctly classified

These stressors highlight an important problem in Puerto Rico. Natural disasters affect Puerto Rico much more acutely not simply because it is an island nation, but because of its poverty and limited access to resources. Puerto Rico's failing public health, transportation, and electric infrastructure (to name a few) sometimes contribute to preventable deaths when natural disasters occur. Each of these stressors demonstrates the levels of under-preparedness among both civilians and government officials. 

**Effects of Maria**
Hurricane Maria highlighted the negative correlation between infrastructure failure and quality of life/safety. In fact, previous hurricanes that were as intense as Maria provided the same insight and made evident that Maria was one case in a series of events that are becoming a cycle. Hurricanes rip apart infrastructure that is already lacking, while austerity policies decrease the amount of public aid being distributed to cautify wounds made. With climate change becoming more of an issue, it is apparent that this cycle may only intensify with the heightened recurrence of natural disasters in the Caribbean.

**The Experiment** 
My goal was to measure the relationship between predatory lending and housing insecurity as stressors on the quality of life of Puerto Rico's elderly, but it became readily apparent that the picture does not simply end or begin with predatory lending or houses. It begins with an evaluation of the well documented poverty in Puerto Rico. The island has been seeing a growing debt that cannot be financed. To make matters worse, funds that were allocated for community development have either benefitted corporate interests in the development of tourist attractions, or redirected funds away from much needed improvements in infrastructure on the island. 

I evaluated the decline in the quality of life as being correlated with the amount of foreclosures and the amount of deaths in the wake of Maria. Quarto, the Center for Investigative Journalism, and the AP calculated the number of dead related to Maria, and of those 487 individuals, approximately 78% of them were 60 or older. This provided insight into the ways that failing infrastructure can lead to higher mortality rates among the elderly. Lack of electricity can lead to complications for those who rely on machinery to assist them (ex. need for respirator machines), failure of public roads can make it difficult to transport injured people to hospitals and can also complicate the delivery of essential medications for those with mental and physical illnesses. Additionally, many people do not know what medical services are available. The report developed by Quarto, the Center for Investigative Journalism, and the AP displays more graphic examples of highly preventable deaths that occurred because of Hurricane Maria. 

These deaths relate to reverse mortgages and predatory lending by demonstrating ways in which vacating homes can still benefit finance corporations who then foreclose on these properties. The presence of hidden "quit claim" deeds, failure to pay forms of insurance, etc have all been reasons cited for companies foreclosing on a home, but one of the biggest has been the failure to prove that one is a permanent resident on the property. By failing to prove permanent residency (either by seeking shelter in the US or by actually vacating the home) finance companies are able to front load the federal court system with suits. The high volume of foreclosure cases led to a moratorium in Puerto Rico, but the foreclosure and delinquency rate is still more than double the American rate. The instance of foreclosure is important because it open up conversations about ways to benefit off of empty properties. 

One difficulty, admittedly, in the research of this topic is that most of the research and data are anecdotal and particuarlized to case studies of people who may have had extreme experiences, so the data is not necessarily neutral, but it does open up discourse about the ethics of the debt investment industry and its ties to Puerto Rico. While these cases are valuable in the sense that they show what could go wrong, they do not necessarily provide an entire picture, so this project is a critique of predatory practices taken up to increase housing insecurity. Homes can be foreclosed on for a variety of reasons, government subsidies may incentivize this behavior, development deals may do the same, but at the heart of it all is money. Companies have been able to benefit from the emptying of Puerto Rico, sometimes in extreme cases. So these are the things that people in and outside of Puerto Rico can do to address this issue.

Below there is an animated story of Pepe the Cat, who becomes homeless in the wake of a hurricane. It was produced as a simple way to demonstrate (on an extreme level) the effects of natural disasters. Hopefully, if you present it at community events, it can be a starting point for what things could have been different so that Pepe's story is a bit happier. Maybe Luis would not have died, or Camila could have kept the house? We may never know, but in thinking about how to assist Pepe, we ponder ways to help an entire island of vulnerable people.
