After the Storm: Pepe's Story 

This project focuses on the effects of **housing insecurity** (specifically caused by reverse mortgages) on the *geriatric community* of Puerto Rico. This topic relates mostly to the study of the ways in which the debt investment industry has affected the lives of Puerto Ricans who are still on the island, and further exacerbated the intense poverty and emigration that characterize the island.
