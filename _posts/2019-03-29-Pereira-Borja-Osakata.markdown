	Food is more than sustenance. The foods we eat and how they are made can speak volumes about the cultures and histories that brought them to life. <br><br>Sancocho, a traditional Puerto Rican stew, is lovingly prepared from commonly found ingredients that, when brought together, magically transform into a satisfying and nourishing meal that can feed a whole community.<br><br>
	Though sofrito serves as the seasoning base for the recipe, ingredients will vary from table to table adapting to what is readily available. But even then, the hearty stew will always have bits of carne (beef), plátano (plantain), yucca (cassava root) y maiz (corn) simmering away  in the caldero (pot). Together, each of these ingredients will fill homes with a delightful, and for many, a nostalgic aroma. </p>
	<image src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/85 percent white.jpg">
	<p>However, our constantly simmering pot of ingredients is no longer locally produced. Colonialism has always centered on the exploitation and destruction of food systems through forced or cheap labor. As the oldest colony in the world, it is intelligible that 85 percent of the island’s food is sourced outside Puerto Rico, including agricultural goods that once grew abundantly on the island. Thus, grocery dollars spent continue to exit the country instead of circulating and strengthening its local economy.  <br><br>While it is highly unlikely that Puerto Rico will ever be able to produce all of its own food, a multiplicity of non-government organizations (NGOs) are working hard to decrease dependence on foreign importation and strengthen agroecological farming practices. Through the humble practice of making sancocho, we trace back the places where ingredients have traveled from and explore the current hegemonic structures that dominate Puerto Rico’s food production. Further, we aim to elevate non-government agencies that are seeking to change it through collective action and radical transparency. </p><br>

<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/01 Meat.png"><i>Meet Import Map</i><br><br>
<p>Sancocho is commonly made with beef and pork proteins. In 2016, Puerto Rico imported approximately 890 million US dollars worth of cow and pig-based meats from fourteen different countries. While some of the beef is being imported from Central America, over 100 thousand kilograms travel from as far out as Australia. <br><br>Such large imports of meat came about with the industrialization of the island in the 1950s. Farmers in rural areas begin migrating to urban areas for new work. Food imports began arriving from the United States to compensate for the reduction in local agricultural production which lead to the creation of supermarkets and, ultimately a longstanding change in Puerto Ricans’ diet. Along with meat, there was now increasing access to processed foods and decreasing variation in produce. Not only did mass importation drastically change how and what Puerto Ricans ate, it also restricted where foods could be purchased. Approximately 43 percent of islanders receive food stamps from the government. Food Stamp purchases are confined to authorized supermarkets, markets with little or no stock of local produce. </p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:14pt;"><i>2. Add Sofrito, Onion, Garlic and Carrots. Cook until Onion is Translucent. </i></span>
<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/02 Sofrito.png"><i>Sofrito Import Map</i><br><br>
<p>Sofrito is a Puerto Rican seasoning base made of garlic, cilantro, culantro, onions, and sweet peppers. The base can be found in almost every home refrigerator making it a central seasoning to Puerto Rican cuisine. Garlic, originally introduced by the Spanish is locally nonexistent. In 2016, 3.5 million kilograms  of garlic valued at 7.5 million US dollars was imported. Further, 16 million US dollars worth of onions and onion products were brought in from places as far as Canada, China, and Denmark. <br><br>The price spent on imported foods continues to be alarming. But, it’s important to note it as a byproduct of colonization capitalistic interest in land production. Decades before the industrialization of the island, the US provided sugar production incentives. This  lead to the overturn of agriculturally diverse lands into management of a single crop; the monocrop. Agriculture lands were shaped up to meet the demands of the global economy and therefore neglected the local food system.

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:14pt;"><i>3. Add Broth. Bring to a Boil. Simmer. </i></span>
<br><br>
<p>Sancocho is figuratively a melting pot of Spanish, African and Taíno roots. During Spanish rule, Africans were brought to the island to replace the decimating Taíno workforce. While enslaved Africans worked the plantations, calderos of sancocho would simmer for hours over a fire breaking up tough proteins pieces. Over the years, the stew would symbolize unity, strength and celebration. Under Spain’s 400 hundred years of governance and control, a Puerto Rican culture and identity materialized. When, the US invaded the island in 1898, they met a peoples whose sense of national identity had already been established. In 1859, the first Puerto Rican cookbook had been published, El Cocinero Puertorriqueño, revealing the rich culture and traditions through recipes. Though literacy rates were low, political awareness and participation was high. US invasion coincidentally occured five months after Spain had created the Autonomic Charter of 1897, the greatest piece of document ever written for a colony. It had given Puerto Ricans full representation and self-governance power. Much more than what is given today under US colonization. Puerto Ricans gained US citizenship under the Jones Act of 1917. But citizenship rights are limited. Puerto Ricans who live on the island are not allowed to vote for president nor do they have any representation in USDA policies.</p><br><br>

<p>Monoculture plantations are in the business of making profits. With the practice of growing one crop on large plots of land many negative consequences arise. Lands are concentrated and kept in the hands of few. Soil health is degraded and nutritionally deficient decreasing production. Dependence is thus spent on agro-chemicals for growth and to ward of diseases. Diseases which were not common on agriculturally diverse rich lands. Agro-chemicals damage the natural ecosystem, polluting water airways, suffocating fish, and in large quantities damaging the health of local residents. Genetically modified seeds need to be purchased for each growing season unlike natural pollination process, Conventional farming costs can add up leaving the small farmer with little to no profit. <br><br> Agroecology farming is an alternative model to industrial farming that is concerned with all aspects of food production. It is free of agro-chemicals and brings back traditional farming methods that enhances ecosystems. Not only is it concerned with how farming is done but with who farms. Inclusive farming focuses on knowledge and the sharing of that knowledge as well as the health of the societies it depends on. Agroecology therefore supports the connections between people and the environment making it an important tool in achieving food sovereignty.

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:14pt;"><i>5. Add Corn. Simmer</i></span>
<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/04 Corn.png"><i>Corn Import Map</i><br><br>
<p>After beef, corn is the second-largest food import of the ingredients of sancocho. Over 154 million kilograms valued at 116 million USD is brought in a variety of forms including whole cobs, frozen kernels, canned nibs, oils, and flours. Ironically, Puerto Rico has the ideal climate for growing corn, giving it three seasons in one year for harvest.<br><br>Monsanto, a multinational biotechnological seed corporation scored big. The GMO seed producer and player in agrotechnological experimentation receives extensive governmental benefits for their branch in Puerto Rico. Monsanto along with other multinational seed corporation control 6,439 acres of the most fertile and arable lands in Puerto Rico; between Guayama and Juana Díaz. 44% of those lands are leased with the government agency. Lands are used mainly for testing and not for the growing of food. Between 2006 and 2015, transgenic seed and agrochemical industry received more than $526 million in subsidies and tax exemptions between 2006 and 2015. The government agency also refunds $2.72 per work hour paid by companies of unskilled laborers. Seed companies also get discounted rates on water sources from PREPA paying $2 per acre-feet while other customers pay from $163 and $325. All these benefits create a paradise for outside corporations to amass large amounts of wealth and damage local ecosystems. And there ability to extract wealth for Puerto Rico is made possible with their government alliances. Thus true agricultural revival and independence will not be achieved through governmental efforts.</p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:14pt;"><i>6. Garnish with cilantro. Eat with your community.
</i></span>
<br><br>
<p>In 2016, 35 thousand kilograms of coriander seeds were imported at a total cost of 70 thousand dollars.<br><br>The seeds of change are being cultivated by Puerto Ricans, a bottom up solidarity approach. This solidarity has sparked numerous NGOS, food projects, and businesses that are focused on reversing the damage done to their local food system. Agro-ecological principles are at the core of grass root agricultural organizations such as Cooperativa Organica Madre Tierra, La Organización Boricuá de Agricultura, Siembra Boricua, Taina Soy Apiario, and El Departamento de La Comida. Together these NGOS have established seed banks, increased distribution of local produce, helped create new eco farming systems for farmers, created school gardens, involved students for learning opportunities, saved beehives, sourced non-governmental funding, supported entrepreneurs and so, so much more. <br><br>These organizations are [largely] led by women and queer people, whom are organizing to dismantle the political and historical processes that have made Puerto Rico 85 percent dependent on food importation. In 2016 alone, over one billion US dollars were spent on foods that had they been circulated within the Puerto Rican economy. We believe these dollars could have made a positive contribution to the local economy had they supported the local food system. <br><br>Puerto Ricans are changing the power dynamic by empowering those in their communities and placing them at the center of the food system. They continue to gather and collaborate with other grass root industries, creating the forces needed for radical transformation and decolonization. At many of these meetings you may find them nourishing one another with bowls of sancocho, practicing their culinary traditions and creating new recipes for food justice.</p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:16pt;"><b>So, How many Countries does it take to make Sancocho?</b></span>
<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/Imports-GIF.gif"><i>Sancocho Ingredients Import Map</i><br><br>
<p>Data revealed that in 2016, about 22 countries were sourced for ingredients common in the making of sancocho. While these locations were found, aggregated data made it impossible to calculate number of miles traveled per food. Under the Jones Act of 1917, all imports are required to stop at a US port and goods are transferred to US cargo ships before arriving in Puerto Rico.  Other common food imports include cooking oils and dairy. Though we were able to find this collection of data, an extensive report outlining what the 85 % of food imports includes or excludes is not readily available. </p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:16pt;"><b>Can Food Sovereignty be achieved without Political Sovereignty?
</b></span><br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/sovereignty teal.jpg"><br><br>
<p>“Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It puts the aspirations and needs of those who produce, distribute and consume food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations.”<br>– Declaration of Nyéléni, the first global forum on food sovereignty, Mali, 2007<br><br>It is clear amongst Puerto Ricans that the current political status is deficient and antiquated. However, it is unclear what an alternative political governance may look like. The current government structure favors a top down approach to solving agricultural production, placing dollars in pockets of large corporations. Non governmental organizations are therefore essential as their bottom up approach genuinely works towards food sovereignty. They have created significant contributions and will need funding to continue their work. But complete food sovereignty will continued to be challenged by political status. </p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:16pt;"><b>Detecting the Pulse of Local Agriculture from a Distance</b></span><br><br>
<p>The map below shows locations and profiles of farms, farmers markets and businesses dedicated to strengthening the local food system and economy. While it is incomplete, we can see sproutings of food justice across the island. We hope that this map will serve as a tool for advocates to network and strengthen their internal networks. We also hope the map can serve as a visual for Puerto Rican consumers who live on and off the island. 1. That they support and see the benefit in supporting local efforts on a daily basis. 2. Provide alternative tourism attractions. </p><br><br> Limitations in our map are due to limitations in locating spatial data that could be analyzed in GIS, geographic information system. This includes identifying agricultural land use, ownership of lands, and a collection of existing farms and their practices. Collaboration with Professors Alexa Dietrich of Wagner College and Adriana Garriga-Lopez of Kalamazoo College have helped us lay the groundwork on farming communities in Puerto Rico. Through intense research and informal interviews with Puerto Ricans, including one of the founders of the Departamento de la Comida, Tara Rodríguez Besosa we gained a better understanding of the agricultural landscape and challenges faced.  <br><br>Other locations who fit this project’s narrative were identified through manually scraping Facebook pages and reviewing posted content. If a project or business had an online presence, recent activity, was focused on a local or agroecological principles, and made location public, then they were added to the map. Yielding 33 farm locations, 10 farmers markets and six miscellaneous businesses. <br><br> We are led to believe that there are 200+ farms and organizations that meet this criteria and could potentially be mapped. However, it has been brought to our attention that many of them are purposely not made public and prefer to be private. A mistrust of project intentions is evident and understandable considering the unjust history and current political structures. A further detailed map will require on the ground work by a local and trusted resident. <br><br>

<p>Sancocho is a communal dish, meant to be shared and eaten with others. It’s made in celebrations of milestones, achievements and also welcoming parties. It is etched on the hearts of those who cherish their Puerto Rican identities and cultures and work to preserve it. </p><br><br>
