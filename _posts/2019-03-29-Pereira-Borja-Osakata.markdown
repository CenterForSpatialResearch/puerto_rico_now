	Food is more than sustenance. The foods we eat and how they are made can speak volumes about the cultures and histories that brought them to life. <br><br>Sancocho, a traditional Puerto Rican stew, is lovingly prepared from commonly found ingredients that, when brought together, magically transform into a satisfying and nourishing meal that can feed a whole community. <br><br>Though sofrito serves as the seasoning base for the recipe, ingredients will vary from table to table adapting to what is readily available. But even then, the hearty stew will always have bits of carne (beef), zanahoria (carrot), plátano (plantain), yucca (cassava root) y maiz (corn) simmering away  in the caldero (pot). Together, each of these ingredients will fill homes with a delightful, and for many, a nostalgic aroma. <br><br>
	<image src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/85 percent white.jpg"><br><br>
	However, our constant simmering of the pot of ingredients is no longer locally produced. Recent reports post-Hurricane Maria, declare that 85 percent of the island’s food is sourced outside the island, including agricultural goods that once grew abundantly on the island. Thus, grocery dollars spent continue to exit the country instead of circulating and strengthening its local economy. <br><br>While it is highly unlikely that Puerto Rico will ever be able to produce all of its own food, a multiplicity of non-government organizations (NGOS) are working hard to decrease dependence on foreign importation. Through the humble practice of making sancocho, we explore the current hegemonic structures that dominate Puerto Rico’s food production and aim to elevate non-government agencies that are seeking to change it through collective action and radical transparency.  </p><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:14pt;"><i>1. Season Pieces of Beef. Dredge and Sear. </i></span>
<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/01 Meat.png"><br><br>
<p>Although chicken variations can be made, sancocho is commonly made with beef and pork proteins. In 2016, Puerto Rico imported approximately 890 million US dollars worth of cow and pig-based meats from fourteen different countries. While some of the beef is being imported from Central America, over 100 thousand kilograms travel as far out as Australia.<br><br>Such large imports of meat came about with the industrialization of the island in the 1950s. Farmers in rural areas begin migrating to urban areas for new work. Thus, food imports began arriving from the United States to compensate for the decrease in local agricultural production. This led to the creation of supermarkets. Puerto Ricans who depend on governmental food stamps can only  are further restricted to making purchases at authorized supermarkets</p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:14pt;"><i>2. Add Sofrito, Onion, Garlic and Carrots. Cook until Onion is Translucent. </i></span>
<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/02 Sofrito.png"><br><br>
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:13pt;">Imports</span><br>
<p>Sofrito is a Puerto Rican seasoning base made of garlic, cilantro, culantro, onions, and sweet peppers. After adding the sofrito, aromatic smells will permeate the air and remind anyone in close proximity of their hunger. One can find a pint in almost every mother’s refrigerator. Additionally, each of the components of sofrito are central to Puerto Rican cuisine, but are largely outsourced from across the world. <br><br>The 16 million US dollars worth of onions and onion products being imported to the island, for example, are being brought in from far-reaching places like China and the Netherlands. </p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:14pt;"><i>3. Add Broth. Bring to a Boil. Simmer. </i></span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:13pt;">Imports</span><br>
<p>After letting the flavors of the aromatics get to know each other for a little bit, beef stock is added to the calderon and brought to boil. The entire mixture will simmer for 30 minutes or so, and then will cook on high until the stock is reduced by half. 
It is believed that sancocho was born out of the African Diaspora. While African people brought from the Spanish Inquisition and enslaved Taínos worked the plantation fields in Puerto Rico, calderons of sancocho were simmering away for hours over a fire in the background. <br><br><br>Puerto Rico is the oldest colony in the world. First conquered by the Spaniards in the early 1500s,  A mixture of Spanish conquistadors, Africans slaves, and native Taínos and formed Puerto Rican culture during this period. However, after this languid period of Spanish settlement, Puerto Ricans found themselves ready to self-govern following the patterns of other Latin American countries who declared Independence in this era. <br><br>But, in 1898, the country was invaded by the United States and Puerto Rico was handed over by the Spanish in the Puerto Rican Campaign that ended the Spanish American War,  effectively moving from one colonizer to the next. </p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:14pt;"><i>4. Add Plátanos, Yucca. Maybe Yautía. Simmer. </i></span>
<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/03 Starches.png"><br><br>
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:13pt;">Imports</span><br>
<p>A variety of starchy fruits and vegetables are added to the stew once the beef has softened and the stock has reduced. This thickens the  Plátanos trace Puerto Ricans back to African roots. Yucca traces us back to Taíno roots. Indigenous ingredients, originally cultivated on the land. These are the crops that have stood the test of time in Puerto Rican cuisine, for they are often the first to recover in the event of a natural disaster. <br><br> However, not all disasters are natural. The colonization of the island by the United States  destroyed the diverse agricultural industry. In the 1950s, “Operation Bootstrap” propelled the Puerto Rican economy away from agriculture, toward manufacturing, industrialization, and tourism. Similarly in this era, local agricultural moved even further away from its once-local orientation, toward mechanized, mono-agriculture positioned to support mainland USA.<br><br> This colonial structure of industrialization ruined the Puerto Rican hacendado elite, dispossessed peasants from land use, and proceeded to reduce the wealth of the island’s agricultural diversity to a single crop: sugar. In essence, the United States made Puerto Rico a captive market for its own agricultural products.

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:14pt;"><i>5. Add Corn. Simmer</i></span>
<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/04 Corn.png"><br><br>
<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:13pt;">Imports</span><br>
<p>After beef, corn is the second-largest food import of the ingredients of sancocho. Over 154 million kilograms valued at 116 million USD is brought in a variety of forms including whole cobs, frozen kernels, canned nibs, oils, and flours. <br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/government white.jpg"><br><br>
Corn is also grown on the island, but not entirely for the purpose of feeding Puerto Ricans. Multinational biotechnological seed corporations, such as Monsanto, control 31 percent of the agricultural land in the the municipality of Juana Díaz, home to the most fertile and arable land of Puerto Rico. It is the transgenic epicenter of Puerto Rico with Bayer CropScience, DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Dow AgroSciences, AgReliant Genetics and Illinois Crop Improvement all have claimed their stake at this part of the island. </p><br><br>

<span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size:13pt;">Imports</span><br>
<p>Cilantro, otherwise known as coriander, was brought into Puerto Rico in the form of 35 thousand kilograms of seeds in 2016. Surprisingly, all of these seeds are being bought from the United States at a cost of around 70 thousand dollars.<br><br>Unlike coriander, the seeds of change for the agriculture industry in Puerto Rico, however, are all being cultivated by Puerto Ricans. Non-governmental organizations [largely] led by women and queer people, are organizing to dismantle the political and historical processes that have made Puerto Rico almost entirely dependent on food importation. As previously mentioned, more than 85 percent of foods are brought from outside countries. In 2016,over one billion US dollars were spent on foods that once grew on the island. 
NGOs are focusing on agroecology principles to reverse damages that have been done and reliance on corporations for inputs. <br><br>Agroecology is concerned with where food comes from, how it is produced, who produces it and how knowledge and skills around food and agriculture are shared. It accompanies this understanding of food and agricultural production with a social, cultural and political context – drawing a picture of our different agricultures, and celebrating their diversity. It provides a holistic understanding of our place in natural cycles and how our farming systems must adapt to and enhance the ecosystems and societies on which they depend.<br><br>Sancocho is a dish that does not cost much to make but can feed many. Chances are you’ll find it at welcome parties, birthday parties, dinner parties, community events, and sometimes even after a brutal storm.

<br><br>
<img src="/puerto_rico_now/images/food_soverignty/Imports-GIF.gif"><br><br>
<p>In this contemporary moment for Puerto Rico, the centralized industrialization and mass importation of food has left many communities in danger of food shortage when that supply is cut off, as was seen during Hurricane Maria.<br><br>It takes 22 countries to produce a commonly made stew on the island. Locating this data was challenging for a number of reasons. Data was aggregated therefore miles traveled a more considering the requirement of the Jones Act. All these food would have had to stop on the US mainland before being shipped to the island. Along with these ingredients some other major foods that are also imported include ______.<br><br>Many NGOs are working to reverse this and are working towards a Food Sovereign Puerto Rico where small farmers and local producers are leaders.

<p>“As of today Puerto Rico is still a colony and is politically limited. They cannot vote on policies yet severely impacted by it. The model of the New Commune sought to decentralize the means of production and consumption. The decentralization of a municipality’s agricultural industry could act as a driver for residents to relearn indigenous methods of food production in which all community members are involved. </p><br><br>
