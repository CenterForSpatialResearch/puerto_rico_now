In the wake of Hurricane Maria, policymakers, teachers, and parents have accused the Puerto Rican government of using the devastation as an excuse to push through measures closing schools and privatizing the education system. **More than 250 schools have already been permanently closed**  and it is expected that at least 14 charter schools will open by the end of next year.  While some education reformers insist these rapid changes are necessary for building an optimized education system, school closings and charterization have been enacted largely without the consultation of local stakeholders, particularly those living in low-income, underserved communities. As the voices of these communities are drowned out and appropriated by politicians, corporations, and Washington interests, local networks of resilience are thrown into disarray. Whereas many locals see their neighborhood public schools as community centers that provide critical social support, grasstop actors only seem to see dilapi-dated, rapidly depopulating buildings that make very little fiscal sense keeping open. By silencing and delegitimizing the impact of local representatives in promoting in-clusive, innovative social change, the grasstop actors have been able to control the narrative. Ultimately, the marginalized people protesting the new education policies have been presented by the state as obstacles in the way of Puerto Rico’s recovery.
