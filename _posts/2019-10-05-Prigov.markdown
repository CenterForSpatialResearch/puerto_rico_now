In the wake of Hurricane Maria, community leaders, teachers, and parents have accused the Puerto Rican government of using the island's devastation as an excuse to push through measures closing hundreds of schools. Part of a series of austerity measures meant to offset debt and optimize resources, these closures were enacted without the consultation or approval of local stakeholders, namely those from low-income, underserved communities. As the voices of these communities are drowned out and appropriated by politicians, corporations, and Washington interests, local networks of resilience are thrown into disarray. Though many locals see their neighborhood public schools as community centers that provide critical social support, grasstop actors only seem to see dilapidated, rapidly depopulating buildings that make very little fiscal sense keeping open. By silencing and delegitimizing the impact of local representatives in promoting inclusive, innovative social change, the grasstop actors have been able to control the narrative. Ultimately, the marginalized people protesting the new education policies have been presented by the state as obstacles in the way of Puerto Rico’s recovery. 

Keeping this in mind, this project will dig beneath the government narrative to (A) identify the physical and social inequalities of school closure impact and to (B) compile a database that brings to light the concealed and resistance stories of those affected by the school closures. Most of the time such stories are presented, they are buried inside articles or journals and presented alongside the government's positivist rhetoric. As such, the database will serve as a highly political tool that reasserts the voices of parents and teachers in the education space. Rather than allow government and private interests to insist that school closure are for the common good, the database will reclaim the agency of families and communities to tell their own understanding of what this common good should be.

Puerto Rico's prolonged debt crisis had already triggered multiple waves of school closures since 2010, but the aftermath of Hurricane Maria inspired new, zealous efforts to reform the island's school system. Just this year, 265 schools have been shut down, pushing the overwhelmingly low-income school system into greater uncertainty and preacarity. While the government insists that these closures are necessary to account for deteriorating infrastructure, shrinking enrollment, and budget shortfalls, each school closure represents a painful loss for its surrounding community. Parents rely on neighborhood schools to educate their kids close to home in an environment that is familiar to them. Teachers rely on parents—who they know well—to bolster learning at home. Students rely on an interconnected network of educators and family members for critical academic and social support. Each red dot on the maps above is, therefore, not just a school closure, but a symbol of a community of parents, teachers, and students severed.
