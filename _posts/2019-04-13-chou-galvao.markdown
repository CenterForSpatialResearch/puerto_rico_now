#### **Aftermath of Hurricane Maria - Pattern of Access to Electricity**

On September 17 of 2017, hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico, leaving everyone - rich and poor, and everywhere, urban and rural - on the island without electricity. Two months later, a vast part of the island was still left in the dark.
Regardless of income, everyone suffered from system failure equally. Priority to restore power was given to urban centers, despite the fact that smaller rural villages were closer geographically to power plants. In total, it took up to 11 months for the island to fully recover its energy infrastructure.

Those who could leave took refuge away from the island. About 6% of the population fled the island in face of Hurricane Maria. However, those who stayed experienced the impact of extended periods of outage.

#### **The Push Towards Solar Energy** 

The complete failure of the energy infrastructure combined with the lack of government support stimulated a new wave of enthusiasm for micro-grid solar energy systems due to the vast potential encompassing the majority of the island. In 2018, as part of a broader package of energy reforms, the Puerto Rico government passed a bill to reach 100% renewable energy by 2050, with interim goals of 40% renewables by 2025 and 50% by 2040. However, this goal seems far from reach as, in the 2016-2017 fiscal year, **only 2%** of the island’s energy came from renewable sources, and *PREPA* (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority) still heavily invests in importing natural gas. So, it comes down to the citizens themselves to adapt to an off-grid solar system.

While a solar system has significant benefits, reducing high prices from imported fossil fuels, as well as building on resilience from extreme weather and vulnerable transmission infrastructure, the solar system technology is still out of the reach of the majority of Puerto Ricans. The current prices to install a household solar system range around **20.000 - 30.000 USD** (quotes from for 3 to 5 kilowatts of photovoltaic (PV) capacity, with around 10 kilowatt-hours of usable storage¹), as foreign private companies such as *Tesla* and *Sunnova* invade Puerto Rican territory.

As communities invest in solar under the threat of another devastating hurricane, we pose the question: **who will have the right to solar electricity in the face of future power outages?**


#### **Identifying a Future Pattern of Access to Solar Electricity** 

The investment in solar energy will change the patterns of a power outage and its recovery. In future hurricanes, the outage will no longer affect everyone and has the potential to further accentuate spatial inequality between those who can and cannot afford a micro-grid system.

While income level plays a role in determining who can afford a solar micro-grid, solar capacity (DNI - Direct Normal Irradiance) is also key to determine who can have access to it.  Even though Puerto Rico has vast sun incidence in its coastline, a large part of its central territory and mountains do not receive the minimum DNI a household need to justify a micro-grid.

Using a method of *Bivariate Choropleth Maps*, we study the relationship between **Median Household Income** (in the past 12 months) and the **Solar Potential** measured by the **Direct Normal Irradiance** (DNI) data to determine who will, most likely, have access to electricity in face of future storms

#### **Call for Action** 

![Island Without Access](/puerto_rico_now/images/outage/landscape_no_access.jpg)

While many see solar as the future of Puerto Rico, over **64%** of households cannot afford these micro-grids, while **34%** will have limited access needing to invest around ⅓ of their household income into solar. A very few **1.6%** of the island will configure the new landscape of those who will likely have access to immediate electricity in face future power outages.

With this latent scenario in which solar energy micro-grids are claimed to be the future of Puerto Rico, it is important to develop a well round implementation plan, that build on both government policies and community organization. If only dependent on current policies and international private companies, solar will not be the answer to Puerto Rico’s energy crises, but it will, in fact, further spacial and social inequality. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=84d80374-6d5a-11e9-8106-0edaf8f81e27" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:200%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

Our call for action builds on a two-fold strategy, 1) government implement guidelines and subsidies and allocate *FEMA* funds to regulate and lower the price of micro-grid solar systems in Puerto Rico, 2) for communities and government to act together to build solar grids in public and civic facilities, such as hospitals, care centers, and schools to turn them into beacons of energy distribution,  amplifying the reach of solar for those that live in areas with low solar capacity. This strategy builds on the existing work of several local organizations such as *Casa Pueblo* and *Verdifica* which been installing community micro-grids in key public infrastructures, so citizens can have access to power when in need.     

It is imperative that both government and communities build on strategies to implement Solar energy in a distributed and equitable way ensuring a resilient energy landscape for Puerto Rico.
