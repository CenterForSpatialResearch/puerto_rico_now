In September 17 of 2017, hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico,  leaving everyone - rich and poor, and everywhere, urban and rural - on the island without electricity. Two months later, vast part of the island was still left in the dark.
Regardless of income, everyone suffered from the system failure equally. Priority to restore power was given to urban centers, despite the fact that smaller rural villages were closer geographically to power plants. In total, it took up to 11 months for the island to fully recover its energy infrastructure.
Those who could leave took refuge away from the island. About 6% of the population fled the island in face of Hurricane Maria. However, those who stayed experienced the impact of extended periods of outage.

The complete failure of the energy infrastructure combined with the lack of government support stimulated a new wave of enthusiasm for micro-grid solar energy systems due to the vast solar potential encompassing the entire island.
Many saw solar as the future of the island’s energy landscape. In 2019, as part of a broader package of energy reforms, the Puerto Rico government passed a bill to reach 100% renewable energy by 2050, with  interim goals of 40% renewables by 2025 and 50% by 2040. However, this goal seems far from reach as the government keeps investing mostly in natural gas systems instead of renewable energy. So, it comes down to the citizens themselves to adapt to a off-grid solar system.

While a solar system has a lot of benefits reducing high prices from imported fossil fuels, as well building on resilience from extreme weather and vulnerable transmission infrastructure, the solar system technology is still out of the reach of the majority of Puerto Ricans. The current prices to fully install a household solar system range around 20.000 USD, as foreign private companies such as Tesla and Sunnova invade Puerto Rican territory. 

Currently the majority of the people rely on power generators, which has a significantly lower initial investment than a solar system. Despite being more affordable, generators run on gasoline, which became equally problematic as municipalities run out of fuel months into the extended power outage. Further making the case for solar-energy systems.


As communities invest in solar for the next hurricane season under the threat of another devastating hurricane, we pose the question that who will have the right to electricity in the future?

The investment into micro-grids will change the pattern of power outage and recovery in future, further accentuating the spatial inequality between those who can afford a micro-grid system and who can’t.

This calls for significant policy change in both local government and FEMA to allocate funding based on communities who need the most financial help. Priority should also be given to civic facilities such as hospitals, care-centers, and schools to turn them into beacons of energy distribution. It also calls for community organized movements to create crowdfunded local micro-grid systems.

This is a document that is written in markdown. What is markdown? It is a 'markup language' that allows you to format plain text in a way that is easily converted to many different formats. For example, this document was written in markdown but will be used as an webpage and converted into HTML.  

To present and turn in your final projects for Conflict Urbanism: Puerto Rico Now you will be editing this template. You will include all of the text of your paper here, along with any and all images, maps, videos, or other materials that you produce.  

[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.  

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  


<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://rchou81.github.io/CU_Bivariance_Map/" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=35c476c8-6d46-11e9-8106-0edaf8f81e27"></iframe></div>
