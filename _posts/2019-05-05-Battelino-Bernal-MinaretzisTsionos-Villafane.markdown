*ISLA VERDE AS A LESSON; OCEAN PARK AS A COUNTER NARRATIVE* 

The current state of vulnerability that Puerto Rico finds itself in provides ample opportunities for fast-paced foreign development without profound analysis of the social and urban transformation it might cause. We identify Ocean Park as one of the areas on the island that is in imminent danger of becoming another gentrified enclave, with foreign investment changing local economic and social structure to a degree for it becoming inaccessible to its current inhabitants. By conducting an analysis on another neighbourhood that already went through this radical transformation, Isla Verde, we believe a comparison could be made in order to project Ocean Park’s future, if action is not taken.

Puerto Rico became even more desirable to American investors after Governor Ricardo Rosselló announced 98% of Puerto Rico as an Opportunity Zone. The announcement came after The US Treasury Department and IRS defined Puerto Rico as an opportunity zone based upon the [US Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0341). Opportunity Zones are intended to foster investment in the *nation’s* disadvantaged communities. Hurricane Maria’s impact on the island fits the rhetoric of investment into low income communities, but whether they will substantially aid needy communities is another question.

**Investment Island: PUERTO RICO NOW**
*It is our intention to demonstrate to Puerto Rico landowners the ease and reward of American Investment in Puerto Rico. It is imperative to note that the information provided on this webpage is to encourage landowners within Puerto rico to understand the value of their land and therefore be able to RESIST uncontrolled foreign takeover of land and its development.*   

1. Puerto Rico is a terretory of the United States. Americans do not need a passport to travel to Puerto Rico so traveling to and from the contiguious United States is hassle free. 
2. Puerto Rico's currency is the USD. Investments to Puerto Rico do not rely on a third party financial instituation for investments to be transferred. 
3. If you move to Puerto Rico you pay zero tax on capital gaines after you become a resident. 
4. Setting up a business on the island allows you to escape the 40% tax rate faced in California or New York. In Puerto Rico, your tax rate is 4%. 
5. Puerto Rico residents are not taxed in the United States on their Puerto Rico sourced income.

Our investigation begins in Isla Verde, one of San Juan’s most tourism oriented neighborhoods. Adjacent to the San Juan airport, and full of US owned franchise hotels and businesses, this area most nearly fills the imaginary of a resortified Puerto Rico.  The Caribbean identity has given way to the monotonous copy-paste hotel architecture that can be found all around the world, just as minority of Puerto Rican businesses have been replaced by gated, palm tree lined branches of global hospitality giants. 
<br>

In the gentrified Isla Verde, with the exile of local business by imported globalized enterprise, we begin to see a shift in what Arjun Appadurai terms ethnoscapes and mediascapes in the area. The ethnoscape, as per Appadurai’s book Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization consists of “the landscape of persons who constitute the shifting world in which we live: tourists, immigrants, refugees, exiles, guest workers, and other moving groups and individuals constitute an essential feature of the world and appear to affect the politics of (and between) nations to a hitherto unprecedented degree” (Appadurai 33). In this case, we consider the US corporations – from the Hilton group to Walgreens (both present in Isla Verde) – and the tourists that provide a motive for such developments, ‘moving groups’ with delocalized interests in Puerto Rico. The presence of this moving group is not beneficial to the local inhabitants of San Juan, and profoundly affects the identity of the neighborhood. This shift in identity is grounds for social injustice, as it precludes the displacement of Puerto Rican people, business, and culture from the area.

Emerging from this test case, our main investigation is focused on the area of **Ocean Park**. Also located close to airport, the touristic areas of Miramar, Condado, Old San Juan, and Santurce, this neighborhood is geographically proximate and similar to Isla Verde. However, the area is not touristy as of the present day, and is in fact is a predominately Puerto Rican neighborhood with its own culture. Simultaneously, it is an area with a high number of abandoned lots and buildings. In the climate of the mediascapes of Puerto Rico advertising the imaginary of a resort destination to the American public, and tax incentives to any US mainland citizen investing in land in Puerto Rico, we believe that Ocean Park presents a fertile ground for what Appadurai calls a *deterritorialization*. The danger for Ocean Park to become another patch of gentrified territory os therefore alarmingly high.

The analysis of plot availability within Ocean Park shows that, despite their relatively small size, they are highly suitable for foreign investment due to their proximity and clustering between each other. Usually, if a foreign investor wants to make a move and buy property for hotel development, they would look for available plots and their adjacent sites to determine suitability. The higher the lot availability within the area, as well as already existing services, the higher is the chance for investment to happen. By knowing the potential price of ones land, this could be avoided.

The urban fabric of santurce, in addition to the previous argument, is a conglomeration of a duality. A modernist plan, and a more ‘organic - looking’ pre USA plan. The colonialist plan lends itself to the presence of empty lots that have the possibility of becoming the central points of investment influence as seen in Isla Verde.
The zoom-in of an area in Ocean Park with road infrastructure locating itself less than a 5 minute walk from the beach shows such possible scenario.

Utilizing what we’ve learned from the current situation of Isla Verde; we can speculate a near future for Ocean park where empty lots deemed big enough for hospitality infrastructure become the central nodes of investment influence.
