#### URBAN FORM

Of the Train Urbano’s sixteen stations, only two are below ground. Delineated in the drawing above, whether a station is above vs below ground impacts the surrounding urban form. For example, adjacent stations, Universidad and Rio Piedras, are underground and do not have a physical presence on Avenida Juan Ponce de León; thus, the area retains density. On the contrary, Sagrado Corazon and Deportivo, run over roads, like an expressway, thus surrounded by parking and large, commercial buildings.

#### AVERAGE COMMUTE TIME
<br/>

Though rates of car ownership in Puerto Rico are similar to the national average (2 per household), employees in Puerto Rico have a longer commute time (27.9 minutes) versus the normal US worker (25.5 minutes). Additionally, 3.13% of the workforce in Puerto Rico have "super commutes" in excess of 90 minutes. While average travel time for the US worker has remained relatively constant (from 2013-2017), the average commute time for the Puerto Rican worker is rising steadily, begging increased efficiency in road infrastructure and wider availability of public transportation.

#### AVERAGE COMMUTE TIME BY PUERTO RICO MUNICIPALITY
The municipalities of Toa Alta (46 min.) and Toa Baja (39 min.) in Puerto Rico have some of the longest commuting times to work of any of the counties tracked by the US Census.  Toa Alta and Toa Baja, west of San Juan, have high rates of workers commuting out of county to work:  Toa Alta 88%, Toa Baja 76%.

#### COST OF RIDE PER KILOMETER
Despite the low initial cost of the Tren Urbano’s ride ticket ($1.50), when income per capita and train system length are taken into account, Tren Urbano provides the least affordable price per kilometer of travel out of 9 established public rail transit systems in the United States, highlighting the lacking value, and lacking affordability of the Tren Urbano.
