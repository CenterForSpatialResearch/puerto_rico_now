#### URBAN FORM

Of the Train Urbano’s sixteen stations, only two are below ground. Delineated in the drawing above, whether a station is above vs below ground impacts the surrounding urban form. For example, adjacent stations, Universidad and Rio Piedras, are underground and do not have a physical presence on Avenida Juan Ponce de León; thus, the area retains density. On the contrary, Sagrado Corazon and Deportivo, run over roads, like an expressway, thus surrounded by parking and large, commercial buildings.
