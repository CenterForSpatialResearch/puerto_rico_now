INTRODUCTION
The Tren Urbano is a single-line, 10.7-mile fixed-guideway rapid transit system that serves the municipalities of San Juan, Bayamón, and Guaynabo in Puerto Rico. It opened in December 2004 and began revenue service in June 2005.
Funded by federal grants, bond proceeds,TIFIA loans and other sources, the the Tren Urbano has cost $2.25 billion so far, almost 80% over budget.
Today, the train system only attracts a third of the rides it needs to break even, and operates at only a 13.33% capacity, well under the 110,000 rail passengers planned by 2010.
More than a decade on, the Tren Urbano is a monument to the folly, bloat and abuse that finally bankrupted Puerto Rico.

![Vignette 1](/images/debt/Vignette1_Early Conception.png)
EARLY CONCEPTION
In 1971 Puerto Rico Planning Board and the U.S. federal government— recommended an islandwide, elevated transit system. In 1989, the Department of Transportation and Public Works officially adopts a proposal to begin design and construction.
<br/><br/>


![Vignette 2](/images/debt/Vignette2_Humble Goal .png)
HUMBLE GOAL
The project was implemented to provide a solution to the continually rising vehicle traffic levels and to bring a new mode of transportation to the most congested sections of the San Juan metropolitan area.

UNDERPERFORMANCE
Today, the train system only attracts a third of the rides it needs to break even, and operates at only a 13.33% capacity, well under the 110,000 rail passengers planned by 2010.

<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.8em;">**PREVIOUS TRAIN LINES IN PUERTO RICO**</span>

Under Spanish rule, a network of trains was constructed on the island that was for the transportation of goods and labor around the island (in that time, sugar cane was the major good transported). These railways continued to be in use as Puerto Rico transitioned to American rule in 1898 and continued for the first half of the 20th century, in this pre-industrial era before Operation Bootstrap and its accompanying large-scale switch to industrial forms of labor.

The first map (1900) shows a scattershot grouping of regional transit running between major coastal cities.

By 1924 rail transport expanded, and was comprised of multiple routes that connected nearly the entire coastline (although this utility was compromised by the fact that there were multiple businesses, private and public, controlling each of these lines—thus, there was no one ticket that you could possibly use to circumnavigate from Caguas to Guyama, for example). This is clearly a rail system that was used for private interests, not the general interests of Puerto Ricans attempting to move from city to city. Additionally, Utuado, Cayey, Lares and other populous locations in the center of the island were separated from this transit system (and still are).

Operation Bootstrap was an economic development strategy in 1950s-60s Puerto Rico that sought to industrialize and modernize the economy of the island. Prior to Operation Bootstrap the economy of Puerto Rico was heavily reliant on agricultural production, including the output of the sugar cane industry that was a critical component of the goods and services being shipped along the original rail lines. Operation Bootstrap aimed to improve on the skillset of the working class, creating a massive amount of industrial jobs in manufacturing and other fields. This labor was aimed to assist the United States market, however, instead of the local market, and relied on United States corporations to invest in their economy.

<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.8em;">**URBAN FORM**</span>

![urban form of above vs below stations](/images/debt/190503_urban form of above vs below stations.png)
Of the Train Urbano’s sixteen stations, only two are below ground. Delineated in the drawing above, whether a station is above vs below ground impacts the surrounding urban form. For example, adjacent stations, Universidad and Rio Piedras, are underground and do not have a physical presence on Avenida Juan Ponce de León; thus, the area retains density. On the contrary, Sagrado Corazon and Deportivo, run over roads, like an expressway, thus surrounded by parking and large, commercial buildings.

<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.8em;">**AVERAGE COMMUTE TIME**</span>

Though rates of car ownership in Puerto Rico are similar to the national average (2 per household), employees in Puerto Rico have a longer commute time (27.9 minutes) versus the normal US worker (25.5 minutes). Additionally, 3.13% of the workforce in Puerto Rico have "super commutes" in excess of 90 minutes. While average travel time for the US worker has remained relatively constant (from 2013-2017), the average commute time for the Puerto Rican worker is rising steadily, begging increased efficiency in road infrastructure and wider availability of public transportation.

<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.8em;">**AVERAGE COMMUTE TIME BY PUERTO RICO MUNICIPALITY**</span>

The municipalities of Toa Alta (46 min.) and Toa Baja (39 min.) in Puerto Rico have some of the longest commuting times to work of any of the counties tracked by the US Census.  Toa Alta and Toa Baja, west of San Juan, have high rates of workers commuting out of county to work:  Toa Alta 88%, Toa Baja 76%.

<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.8em;">**COST OF RIDE PER KILOMETER**</span>

Despite the low initial cost of the Tren Urbano’s ride ticket ($1.50), when income per capita and train system length are taken into account, Tren Urbano provides the least affordable price per kilometer of travel out of 9 established public rail transit systems in the United States, highlighting the lacking value, and lacking affordability of the Tren Urbano.

<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.8em;">**AREA SERVED BY THE TREN URBANO**</span>

![area served and bus map](/images/debt/Area Served and Bus Map-01.png)

This map shows both the preexisting bus routes in San Juan as well as the relative area of coverage for each stop along the Tren Urbano. The map shows a major overlap between areas serviced by bus routes and areas serviced by the Tren Urbano--this shows a shortsightedness in the planning for the Tren Urbano, because although buses and trains should overlap when providing connections to a larger extended train network, the current staion with its relatively small area serviced becomes redundant as public transportation.

![PR Tren urbano map and speculative routes](/images/debt/PR Tren Urbano map (and Speculative routes)-01.png)

Although there were more lines/stations planned for the Tren Urbano (7 lines in total that would connect to Old San Juan, the airport, Condado, as well as father-out counties that have significant populations that commute to San Juan like Toa Baja and Caguas), the Tren Urbano did not have political leaders that would commit to finishing the expansion, nor did an expansion of the train seem fiscally feasible after the completion of Phase 1.

<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.8em;">**CRIME DENSITY**</span>

The map shows the crime density and its spatial relation with the Tren Urbano route and stations. The blue line indicates the ground route. The underground route is mainly located at Río Piedras neighborhood, including station Río Piedras and Universidad. The crime density is higher at some large intersections. Most of the stations are located at the main intersections with open parking lots around, where the crime happens more frequent than neighbor area. The Río Piedras station has a higher crime density, which renders people to avoid taking the train from the station.
