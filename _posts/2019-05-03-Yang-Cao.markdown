<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:2em;">**Introduction**</span>

Puerto Ricans no longer trust water after Hurricane Maria. “The water comes out of the tap white, and sometimes dark and dirty, with particles in it.” Marta Rivera said, who lives in the city of Arecibo and she blamed her illness on water contaminated by the hurricane. The water quality of Puerto Rico still was inconsistent ten months after hurricane Maira, the inefficient recovery of water quality heavily impaired Puerto Ricans life. This case study focuses on water treatment infrastructure and how other infrastructure might influence their efficiency throughout Puerto Rico.

Damage to Puerto Rico was severe and widespread following the Hurricane, with heavy rainfall, flooding, storm surge, and high winds causing considerable damage. According to the FEMA, Hurricane Maria knocked out water service for about half of the island’s residents. Wastewater treatment plants were damaged, and so were many of Puerto Rico’s 114 drinking water treatment plants. More than a third of sewage treatment plants were inoperational after the hurricane, said the Environmental Protection Agency in October. This led to raw sewage appearing in water used for residential needs like cooking and bathing. Up to 50% of the population had no access to clean drinking water.

Meanwhile, The power grid was mostly destroyed, causing a power outage for the entire population. Electrical recovery for many locations has taken months, with estimates placing 45% of the population without power three full months after the storm.  
FEMA, along with its federal and NGO partners, have also worked closely with the respective Governors and agencies in the USVI and PR to ensure that temporary power support continues to be prioritized for critical facilities such as hospitals, police and fire stations, communications facilities, and water treatment plants.

<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:2em;">**Comparison of Water Treatment Infrastructure**</span>

We select three water treatment plants of different site condition to discuss what impact the efficiency and recovery of water treatment plants during and after the hurricane.

This diagram shows how water treatment plants work. The situation of “No. 4” primary Clarifier ( sediment tank) will help us identify the functionality of the water treatment plan.

The first water treatment plant is located in rural area. The main infrastructure effect the water treatment plant non-operational sectors that is the energy system and the transportation system.

The zoom in pictures identify the sectors which affect water treatment plant. The right side shows during the hurricane, lack of energy supply effect the primary clarification section become non-operating. The left side shows the road was blocked by the fell down trees and delay the recovery .

The second water treatment plant is located in the coastal area near an urban area. The main infrastructure sectors effect that is energy system.

The third water treatment plant is a control group which located in the coastal area and near a solar energy station.

During the hurricane, the water treatment plant still operates because of the independent power supply system via the solar energy station.

<br/><br/>
Those comparisons display the main sector effect water treatment plants is energy infrastructure. The transportation infrastructure may delay the speed of recovery. After Comparing the water treatment plants in different locations, We zoom out to Puerto Rico Region Scale to talk about how the water treatment system has been effect by other infrastructure networks.

<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:2em;">**Infrastructure Network throughout Puerto Rico**</span>

we first map out the water system, sewage treatment plants and water filtration plants of Puerto Rico. Dense river network exists in the inland rural area, and lots of sewage treatment and water filtration plants work cohesively.

<br/><br/>
![concept_image](/puerto_rico_now/images/infrastructure/energy-small.jpg)
Electricity power substation supply energy for other infrastructures. The existing substations mainly exist along the waterfront, where main cities are. And there are much fewer substations exist in inland rural area, which might be one primary reason for slow recovery of energy in inland area after the hurricane.

Major highway network of Puerto Rico also mostly serve the waterfront urban area while most of the inland rural area is not covered. We also map out the route blocked during the hurricane, and most of them happened in the inland rural area as well as the way from the urban area to inland area. The inconvenience of transportation also impaired the sustainability of the inland area.


<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:2em;">**Conclusion**</span>
![concept_image](/puerto_rico_now/images/infrastructure/overlay-small.jpg)

Recover from the damage of the hurricane is not something that can be done in the short term, as well as letting people re-establish faith on water quality in Puerto Rico. The recovery and improvement of the infrastructure network is essential. Existing/Proposed infrastructure mainly focus on waterfront city centers, and somehow neglect the importance of the inland rural area and their connection with urban. For further development, developers must value the importance of a comprehensive infrastructure network, recover and improve infrastructure network in both waterfront and inland area.
