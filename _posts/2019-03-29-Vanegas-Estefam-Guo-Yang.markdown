<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:2em;">**1.Reconstruction is Underway**</span>

Puerto Rico is in a state of serious change. Over a year since the devastation of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, federal disaster aid continues to be withheld by Congress, forcing recovery efforts to continue unaided by the federal government. Prior to the storms making landfall in November 2017, residents of the island had already been feeling the effects of rising unemployment, crippling debt, and exploitative development practices for several decades. In addition to the loss of over 3,000 lives, the destruction left in the wake of these storms pushed much of the island’s infrastructure and resources past capacity. For many, this disaster has been the final motivator to leave Puerto Rico. Those who remain will be the first to bear witness to dramatic changes as reconstruction properly begins.

<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.5em;">**1-1.In February of 2019, Congress Approved $1.5 Billion in Relief Aid**</span>
  
To understand what these changes may be and how Puerto Rico will be transformed, our research team began an initial investigation into the island’s ongoing demographic and economic shifts within a historical context to answer four questions:
  
  - Who stands to profit and who stands to suffer from reconstruction efforts?
  - Which areas are going to see the greatest change?
  - How are these areas going to be redeveloped, and at what cost?
  - What are the alternatives to our prediction?

<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.5em;">**1-2.That Same Year, Puerto Rico Reported a Record-Breaking 1.7 Million Tourists in 2018**</span>  
  
Though it is impossible to know the future, our team has identified multiple directions in which Puerto Rico may be headed using this data. Without loss of generality, we chose to develop and focus on two hypothetical future scenarios that favor the interests of individuals on opposite ends of a spectrum of figures who wish to see Puerto Rico prosper in different ways. In doing so, we hope to provide a specific picture of what is possible in the near future, as well as to highlight the dangerous processes underway in Puerto Rico at the present moment. 
  
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:2em;">**2.Two Scenarios: A Business-Class Tourist Paradise, or an Island for the People?**</span>
  
![concept photo](/puerto_rico_now/images/future_scenarios/concept_image.png)
  
On one end of this spectrum lie developers, investors, politicians, and citizens who view Puerto Rico as a potential tourist haven, corporate tax shelter, or both. Such individuals benefit from economic incentives to develop Puerto Rico using American capital. On the other end of the spectrum lie Puerto Ricans who draw inspiration from a rich history of collective community organization to envision an island free of the extraction practices inherent to the colony. Such a Puerto Rico is organized into collective land trusts, has a diverse economy focused on local production and reinvestment into municipalities, and engages directly with global actors. 

We understand, of course, that these are two extremes on a broad spectrum that includes individuals and groups with aligned, conflicting, and often competing interests. Yet in examining the ideology behind opposite ends of this spectrum and proposing our own radical future for the island tailored to each, we hope to reach a richer picture of where Puerto Rico is heading, how many of the factors contributing to change were already in place before the recent natural disaster, and what is being done currently to effect changes that, inevitably, will leave some better off and others deeply unsatisfied. 

<br/><br/>  
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.5em;">**2A.Exploitation and Extraction: A Scenario for Predatory Development**</span>
  
Puerto Rico has long been a source for wealth extraction under colonial powers from Spain to the United States. Though legally classified as an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico remains subject to exploitative laws that continue to profit American venture capitalists, developers, and investors. The business ventures of these figures often generate profits without providing significant job growth or tax revenue to the island. 
  
<br/><br/>  
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.2em;">**An Existing Legal Framework Incentivises Exploitative Development**</span>
  
Our first scenario imagines a future in which such figures have developed Puerto Rico into a lucrative enterprise that operates with few local employees and is exempt from significant municipal, territorial, and federal taxes. Tourism--already a major part of Puerto Rico’s economy--has become the dominant industry on the island, providing luxury as well as discount services to tourists of all classes. Tax-sheltered business developments employ a small percentage of Puerto Ricans with sufficient education and wealth to make a relatively easy transition into the tech and finance sectors. Were such a scenario to be realized, we predict the greatest developments and their immediate consequences would most likely occur in the areas shown in the map below.

*Tourism Scenario Decision Making Map*
 
<br/><br/>
We began our investigation by imagining ourselves in the role of someone who possesses sufficient capital and desire to develop in Puerto Rico, and then constructed this map to see where the greatest incentive lay for our venture. It was necessary to first consider the zoning regulations of the island. Revitalization areas are regions designated by the government of Puerto Rico as badly in need of development. As such, these places are offered up to developers with significant tax breaks. Naturally Protected Areas and Difficult Development areas are regions where development is generally prohibited by law or discouraged by challenging geography. In addition, areas that have undergone significant depopulation following the hurricanes were considered using data from the Humanitarian Data Exchange. People often leave Puerto Rico for multiple reasons; resources can run out, unemployment can soar, and properties can be foreclosed. Such areas, however, present an advantage to investors who can buy up cheap and develop without the obstacle of displacing many existing inhabitants.  

![Tourism Layer Breakdown](/puerto_rico_now/images/future_scenarios/tourism_breakdown.png)  

<br/><br/>
Most entrepreneurs, investors, and developers wish to see the greatest return on an investment with as little risk as possible, and look to examples of lucrative operations already turning a profit. Tourism should immediately come to mind. In spite of the destruction of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, the number of tourists lodging in hotels across the island was up to a  record-breaking 1,766,578 guests in 2018. This makes building a hotel, resort, spa, or attraction in an expensive area frequented by high-end visitors a good location for a profitable venture. Below are shown the locations of existing hotels, ranked by price, where we expect to see proportional future development.  
 
<div style="padding:60% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/yqjim111/cjuoazzbsbe001fn0v71i4psi.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoieXFqaW0xMTEiLCJhIjoiY2psb2k5ZGZkMXR1czNxdDV3dW55b3hyaiJ9.ihJM3eJ8hNrDmr7EYKjo7w#7.5/18.241454/-66.318462/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
*Tourism Density - Hotel Density and Price* 

<br/><br/>
Finally, we considered the debt of each municipality as reported by the Puerto Rican Bureau of Statistics in determining which areas will likely see the greatest investment in the near future. Areas with less debt received a higher ranking within an economic index, and marked as the most attractive for developers in the map below. White municipalities were left out of the government study that provided this economic data, and therefore were not considered.  
  
 
<div style="padding:60% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/yqjim111/cjuo9rawabonc1flpiitc01fg.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoieXFqaW0xMTEiLCJhIjoiY2psb2k5ZGZkMXR1czNxdDV3dW55b3hyaiJ9.ihJM3eJ8hNrDmr7EYKjo7w#7.5/18.241454/-66.318462/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
*Economics Index* 

<br/><br/>
Together, these factors determined regions in which we expect to receive the most American investment. Lighter municipalities--largely located within the interior--will likely see further unemployment and lower incomes, prompting increased migration. Areas on the periphery may be gentrified or developed in other ways to meet the needs of coastal regions and urban centers where the vast majority of Puerto Rico’s wealth is now concentrated. Puerto Ricans who remain employed in these rich, swanky municipalities will largely be occupying jobs in the service sector, with a small population of local mid-level management and an even smaller class of local investors and profiteers.  

Why invest in Puerto Rico? As long as the capital we use to develop originates in the United States--via a real-estate holding company, mutual fund, or typical venture capitalist development operation--we benefit from a triple tax break offered to US investors. Moreover, some 98% of the island is classified as an Opportunity Zone; allowing us to reinvest capital gains from our initial investment into an income tax-free Opportunity Fund. Together, these advantages may save our investors up to 37.5% in federal taxes. 

<br/><br/> 
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.5em;">**2B.One (Potentially) Adequate Intervention: a Collective Scenario for Puerto Ricans**</span>  

Puerto Rico does not, by any means, have to follow this narrative. Consider that Congress has appropriated $18.5 billion in hurricane relief aid, (a previous $1.5 billion was approved for spending back in February, and so is not included in our analysis). Additionally, some 23.8% of Puerto Rican debt has recently been argued to be unconstitutional. Combining potential disaster relief aid and forgiven debt leaves the government of Puerto Rico in a significantly better financial position to provide for its residents in reconstruction efforts.  


<div style="padding:60% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/yqjim111/cjuo8ys5p066h1fpln1cxlrw6.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoieXFqaW0xMTEiLCJhIjoiY2psb2k5ZGZkMXR1czNxdDV3dW55b3hyaiJ9.ihJM3eJ8hNrDmr7EYKjo7w#7.5/18.241454/-66.318462/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
*Lantrust Scenario Decision Making Map*

<br/><br/> 
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.2em;">**Puerto Rico has a Rich History of cooperative enterprises**</span>

Our Collective Scenario is so named because it draws upon a rich history of co-ops, inclusive work practices, land trusts, and past social welfare policies that were later struck down by the United States. Numerous political figures, such as Pedro Albizu Campo, were jailed by the United States for attempting to organize workers. During the process of drafting a constitution in the 1950’s, the framers of Puerto Rico’s constitution attempted to include a provision for the right to work, a measure vetoed by the United States Congress, and an issue which is still debated today.  

<br/><br/> 
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.2em;">**The Development of Collective Work Practices and Land Trusts is Underway**</span>

In the present moment, numerous examples can be found of cooperative practices in Puerto Rico that fortify communities and protect exploited and persecuted populations. Consider farming co-ops, some of which address the serious issue of food insecurity in Puerto Rico. Many of these collectives are run by women--others are self-proclaimed safe spaces for queer and LGBT communities. The community of Caño Martín Peña is famous as Puerto Rico’s only land trust. Located near the wealthy district of Milla de Oro, the eight neighborhoods that make up the trust faced serious threat of gentrification. While the land trust effectively prevents residents from losing their homes to gentrifiers or to competing land claims, the area remains impoverished and residents at risk of being priced out. Communities such as Rio Piedras are in the early stages of organizing in to a land trust, an endeavor which requires significant legal effort and expenses.

<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:2em;">**3.Necessary Conditions for the Success of a Cooperative Scenario**</span>

Though these isolated examples of collective organization are inspiring, many are also struggling. It will require the support of these bottom-up practices from a major funding source to help guarantee their long-term success in the early stages of establishment as well as encourage others to follow suit. As such, our scenario requires us to suppose three things when considering the spending of a promised $18.5 Billion of disaster relief aid:

<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.5em;">**3-1.Federal Aid Must Put to the Task of Providing, not of Restoring:**</span>

  - The provision of basic goods and services--including health care and public education, the development of infrastructure in the poorest municipalities, and the recognition of human rights
  
  - The provision of basic goods and services--especially healthcare and education--must be provided at little to no cost to all Puerto Ricans, many of whom mourn the loss of loved ones who perished from preventable causes following the hurricanes. 

  - Local businesses, partnerships, collectives, and co-ops must be encouraged, through subsidies or tax incentives, and predatory development disincentivized, in an effort to close the income gap across Puerto Rico

*Unemployment*

<br/><br/>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.5em;">**3-2.The Case for a Freer Puerto Rico: What Needs to Happen to Ensure Long-Term Success**</span>
The previous scenario was developed supposing that only disaster relief funds be used to provide goods and services that were already lacking in Puerto Rico while aiding local businesses, partnerships, and cooperatives to generate employment and begin a path out of poverty. Ambitious to say the least, such a scenario will be hard pressed to succeed in a short amount of time. For a longer-term solution to take effect, we will need some more ambitious conditions.  


  - **Provision must be made for the restructuring of Puerto Rico’s $74 billion debt Specifically, the $17.6 billion debt issued after    Puerto Rico reached its constitutional debt limit must be forgiven**  
  - **Transparent Puerto Rican lawmakers must be allowed to spend this total sum of $36.1 billion to reinvest in Puerto Rico, rather than rebuild failing systems**  
  - **An end must be brought to the triple-tax breaks and Opportunity Zones that have enabled predatory development to bleed Puerto Rico of its resources**  
  - **The Jones Act of 1917 must be repealed to allow Puerto Rico to engage in commerce with global actors independent of the restrictions of the US Merchant Marine**  
  

<div style="padding:60% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://yqjim111.github.io/conflicturbanism/" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
*Future Scenario-Weekly Wage*

<br/><br/>  
Below is a familiar map showing the income disparity in Puerto Rico at present, as well as a best-case scenario in which residents of the poorest municipalities are able to fetch a salary within 15% of the highest average weekly salary of any Puerto Rican municipality. Our investigation revealed that poorest 50% of Puerto Ricans earn less than half as much as their compatriots in the riches municipality, Juncos. Moreover, at 9.3%, Puerto Rico’s unemployment rate is more than double the national average. Combine this with a much higher number of people pushed out of the formal labor force, and it’s clear to see that significant spending and reinvestment must be made into preparing Puerto Rico as a political entity to operate with greater autonomy after 500 years and counting of colonial rule. Whether this entails a reclassification of Puerto Rico as a political entity is another matter. What is certain is that solutions such as the land trust of Caño Martín Peña or the development of a community plantain farm require greater foresight and intervention to improve the quality of life for residents long term. These solutions buy time, during which a new generation must be educated, existing institutions must be preserved, infrastructure developed, and local commerce allowed to grow slowly. Such investments in individual residents, particularly in populations that have been left neglected by their government for generations, require enormous time to produce tangible results and reflect an improved quality of life. There exists, too, an experimental quality to this scenario, one that implies far greater uncertainty than an island ruled by tourists and hedge funds. But it is precisely this degree of uncertainty involved in promoting the general welfare through provision for individuals that demands action.
