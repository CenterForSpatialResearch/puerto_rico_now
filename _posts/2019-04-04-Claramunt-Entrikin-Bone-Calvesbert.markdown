Last September on 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by a category 4 hurricane leaving unprecedented devastation, revealing a deeper crisis, not only economical but highlighting a combination of factors from the physical, social and spatial vulnerabilities that place Puerto Ricans in constant climate risk.The island of Puerto Rico measures 100 x 35 miles approximately with a population that rounds to 3.3 million in 2017 all which experienced a full black-out for months due to wiping out of the central infrastructure be it electrical, water, telecommunications or transportation. Also, the death toll product after the hurricane extended to thousands, public schools have closed, health administration has decreased, and the lack of emergency preparedness and limited resources are constantly threatening local capacity from communities to institutions to respond swiftly. Moreover, Puerto Rico suffered from a lack of effective and immediate response to this catastrophe, with shared responsibilities from the Central Puerto Rican government to the Federal government along with the disparate deployment of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) when compared with past events.  This catastrophe starts shifting from a natural one to human-made disaster marking the pertinence of investigating and mapping municipalities at risk.

Hurricane María also resurfaced an economic crisis and population loss that has been building up since 2006 as seen in the line-graphs.Before the hurricane,  Puerto Rico was experiencing decades of economic constraints at multiple levels that lead the island default multiple times creating  a debt load of $74 billion dollars-- systematically crunchy livelihood opportunities. Now the crippling territory is forced to deal simultaneously with the so-called public debt and the reconstruction of the country.

Given that Puerto Rico is under a tight scenario by having a Lack of economic development Financial debt, Unprecedented disaster recovery process, Fiscal reconstruction and Financial debt the project explore the same question but at the municipality level. In order to have a better idea of the Island and to further understand the geography that we explored is important to highlight that Puerto Rico has Seventy-eight municipalities with various geographical conditions, from coastal to inland including Culebra and Vieques that are separate Islands. Therefore it is difficult to create a baseline for comparison since they vary not only in territory extension but also have diverse socio-economic conditions.

<p>
Municipalities are a Second layer governance, and are subjected to “state”, and Federal laws of United States. In order to have a better idea of the Island and to further understand the geography that we explored is important to highlight that Puerto Rico has Seventy-eight municipalities with various geographical conditions, from coastal to inland including Culebra and Vieques that are separate Islands. Therefore it is difficult to create a baseline for comparison since they vary not only in territory extension but also have diverse socio-economic conditions. Yet, municipalities as localities, have become important arenas for decision-making, their role has had a pendulum effect during Puerto Rico's planning and management of the urban fabric marking their importance as a study unit.

<p>
Given the federal and island government’s inadequate response and the importance of municipalities in addressing local emergencies the project explores the physical and social vulnerability at the municipality level. In order to have a better idea of the Island and to further understand the geography and its municipalities is important to highlight that the  seventy-eight municipalities have various geographical conditions, from coastal to inland and from rural to urban areas in addition to having  two separate municipal-islands Culebra and Vieques. Therefore using municipalities as a unit of study has constraints and difficult the creation of a baseline for comparing all municipalities at once since they vary not only in territory extension but also have diverse socio-economic conditions. However, acknowledging that municipalities are the second layer of governance (reflecting to an extent the central one) and at the same time are subjected to the “State” and Federal laws of the United States also marks a reason to study them. Yet, municipalities as localities, have become important arenas for decision-making, their role has had a pendulum effect during Puerto Rico's planning and management of the urban fabric marking their importance as a departing point to look at.

**Due to the enormous importance of municipalities to the ability of communities to survive disasters, by cross-referencing physical and social vulnerability, the project highlights what are the areas (Municipalities) at most risk in the event of another hurricane**

>"Disasters are sometimes considered external shocks, but disaster risk results from the complex interaction between development processes that generate conditions of exposure, vulnerability and hazard. Disaster risk is therefore considered as the combination of the severity and frequency of a hazard, the numbers of people and assets exposed to the hazard, and their vulnerability to damage."(UNISDR, 2015a)

MAPPING MUNICIPALITIES AT RISK IN PUERTO RICO**

<p>
This project develops a decision model based utilizing *social* and *physical* vulnerability metrics that are first mapped individually and afterwards added into one final model to render a digital map showing a higher risk for municipalities together with other possible impact in their capacity to recover in the event of another hurricane. By acknowledging the definition of disaster risk , which is expressed as the likelihood of loss of life, injury or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time (UNISDR, 2015.) This project incorporates social vulnerability aspects including sensitivity and adaptive capacity of communities, along with physical vulnerability including exposure to hazards as landslides and flooding, some which are still an ongoing impact of Hurricane María.

&nbsp;

<p>
The Physical vulnerability considers environmental conditions and registered impacts on the housing stock retrieved by using FEMA’s Individual assistance information and existing datasets from the build environment. The analysis considers “municipios” as a primary unit given the recopilated information is quantified at this level of governance. An existent social vulnerability index (SVI) for Puerto Rico developed in 2017 was revised, but as it is based on census tracts is not transferable to our study. This difference between census tracts and municipios is relevant because municipios are in charge until this moment of implementing and coordinating local acton plans also marking the as key players in the provision of services and resilience efforts for the communities.

<p>
After identifying and mapping physical and social vulnerability indicators that further inform the current status of municipalities in Puerto Rico, the project performs a decision model that combines these two approaches by visualizing municipalities that are at most risk and vulnerable in the case of another climate event. The decision model shows three alternatives to identify municipalities at risk, first prioritizing social vulnerability, second prioritizing physical vulnerability and finally an unweighted map in which both physical and social indicators have the same weight.

<p>
The results of the analysis of Social and Physical vulnerability at a municipal level throughout a combined layer decision model marks that the municipalities of Yabucoa, Canóvanas, Comerío, Utuado, Juncos, and Naguabo are consistently ranking high scores. The scores suggest that significant conditions of vulnerability are in place signaling their risk to be able to recover at the moment and in future climate events. These identified municipalities could serve as case studies for further research and a starting point for any program or effort that offers extra aid or support that will come in the future. By identifying these five municipalities it can be argued that all the geographic conditions found in Puerto Rico are at stake since these five municipalities are from either the inner central mountainous region, coastal part or at the urban denser peripheries.
&nbsp;
In general Hurricane Maria revealed that the mitigation plans against hazards in Puerto Rico are not uniform, which makes it difficult for some of the municipalities to request and receive funds to finance the projects that could place them in a better position in regard of managing future emergencies. The mitigation plan is a document generated by the municipal government of Puerto Rico. Out of the five municipalities three (Utuado, Yabucoa and Comerío) have already been chosen by Puerto Rico’s Planning Board to provide support in reviewing and updating their mitigation plans (Alvarado,2019).

September 20. 6:15 a.m. It is the official time in which hurricane Maria, category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, enters through Yabucoa. This is a southeastern town with ten barrios: Aguacate, Calabaza, Camino Nuevo, Guayabota, Jácana, Juan Marín, Limones, Playa, Pueblo, and Tejas. This area is known for its farmers and agricultural lands-- mostly produces plantains all heavily affected by the storm(3,000 to 4,000 acres of plantains were destroyed.)

Canóvanas is located in the northeastern region including six barrios; Canóvanas
Canóvanas barrio-pueblo, Cubuy, Hato Puerco, Lomas, and Torrecilla Alta. Since 2004, and based on law 1-2001,  19 communities in Canóvanaswere designated as Special Communities  (Comunidades especiales) in Puerto Rico to address high levels of poverty and lack of resources and opportunities.Floods are typical during the storm season, between June and November. Most flat areas are subject to occasional flooding and flood-prone alluvial valley of the Río Grande de Loíza and its main tributaries, the Río Canóvanas and Río Canovanillas.
&nbsp;
According to local news and FEMA Canóvanas has the third-worst housing damages on the island, And yet, it is one of the towns with the largest number of housing units with unattended needs, according to municipal documents.

<p align="left">
Utuado is located in the central mountainous region of the island known as La Cordillera Central provoking massive landslides and downed trees that blocked the accessibility for the whole town for weeks. Utuado is also under a critical situation not only by nature but also because man made hazards as the  unmaintained the reservoirs of Dos Bocas has not been cleaned in decades hindering it capacity to retain water. Almost everything got washed out or covered with dirt when the combination of storm rain, full reservoir and destruction went out of control for the rural communities.

Ceiba Norte, Ceiba Sur, Gurabo Abajo, Gurabo Arriba, Juncos barrio-pueblo, Lirios, Mamey
Valenciano Abajo, and Valenciano Arriba. Since 2004, and based on law 1-2001,  8 communities in Juncos were designated as Special Communities  (Comunidades especiales) in Puerto Rico to address high levels of poverty and lack of resources and opportunities; Flores, Santana 1 in Ceiba Norte, Canta Gallo, El Caracol, La Cuesta, Sector El Mangó, La Hormiga, Lirios Dorados, Hoyo Hondo
Rosalía, Sector El Mangó. Juncos was declared a disaster area by the passage of Irma and María aggravated the situation to worst conditions since it  triggered numerous landslides. Juncos reported more than 1,000 people without roofs. At the same time this town reported problems of access to drinking water, gasoline, diesel and electricity, affected by landslides, floods and the fall of a large part of the power line that keeps almost 50 percent of its residents without electricity.

Based on local news the most affected sectors of Juncos were; La Placita, La Coroza, Mamey, Jacaranda, Mango (sectors Campo Alegre and Rosalia), Valenciano Arriba and Valenciano Abajo, as well as highways PR-198, PR-183, PR-185 and PR-919.
