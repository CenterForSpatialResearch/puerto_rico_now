>For September 20th marks claims “Hurricane María led to the biggest failure of American disaster response since Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005.” -Daniel Farber (2018) 

**What areas of Puerto Rico are at the most risk in the event of another hurricane?**

This project develops a decision model based in *social* and *physical* vulnerability metrics that are first mapped individually and secondly added into one final model to render a map showing higher risk for municipalities and possible impact in their capacity to recover in the event of another Hurricane.

Disaster risk is expressed as the likelihood of loss of life, injury or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time. UNISDR Global Assessment Report 2015

>Disasters are sometimes considered external shocks, but disaster risk results from the complex interaction between development processes that generate conditions of exposure, vulnerability and hazard. Disaster risk is therefore considered as the combination of the severity and frequency of a hazard, the numbers of people and assets exposed to the hazard, and their vulnerability to damage (UNISDR, 2015a).

**Social Vulnerability Results**

The social vulnerability indicators will be based on demographic and socioeconomic factors, including the change in populations related to migration post Hurricanes. 

**Physical Vulnerability Results**

**The Physical vulnerability index** will consider environmental conditions and impact in housing stock by using existent and new datasets. The analysis will consider “municipios” as a primary legal division of Puerto Rico. An existent **social vulnerability index (SVI)** for Puerto Rico developed in 2017 will be revised, but as it is based on census tracts is not transferable to our study. This difference is
relevant because municipios are in charge of implementing and coordinating local government actions being a key player in the provision of services and resilience of communities. 

The following proxies will be considered to measure social vulnerability and physical vulnerability, generating a decision model to map the municipalities by scores in each index.
