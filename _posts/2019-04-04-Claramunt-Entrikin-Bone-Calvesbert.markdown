>In September 20th in 2017 Hurricane María led to “the biggest failure of American disaster response since Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005.” -Daniel Farber (2018)

<p>
The devastation produced by Hurricane María was unprecedented and revealed the deep crisis, not only economical but also the physical, social and spatial vulnerabilities that place Puerto Rico in constant climate risk. The whole archipelago of Puerto Rico suffered from a lack of effective and immediate response to the catastrophe, with shared responsibilities from the local government to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The islands experienced full black-out for months, the death toll product of the hurricanes passing extended to thousands, health administration has decreased, and lack of social services are consistently threatening local capacity to respond from communities to institutions.

**By cross-referencing physical and social vulnerability the project highlights what are the areas at most risk in the event of another hurricane?**

>"The volatile nature of economic and population activity generates the need to locate public policies decisions geographically even more relevant."

Before the hurricane, Puerto Rico had acquired new layers of complexity considering that the islands defaulted on their loans payments obligation, and instituted an ongoing and deep crisis. Now the territory is said to be responsible for the so-called public debt that amounts $74B. Approximately $24 billion is issued by municipalities and public corporations and $50 billion on pension liabilities of the $74 billion debt.

Given that Puerto Rico is under a tight scenario by having a Lack of economic development Financial debt, Unprecedented disaster recovery process, Fiscal reconstruction and Financial debt the project explore the same question but at the municipality level. In order to have a better idea of the Island and to further understand the geography that we explored is important to highlight that Puerto Rico has Seventy-eight municipalities with various geographical conditions, from coastal to inland including Culebra and Vieques that are separate Islands. Therefore it is difficult to create a baseline for comparison since they vary not only in territory extension but also have diverse socio-economic conditions.

**What municipalities in Puerto Rico are at most risk in the event of another hurricane?**
&nbsp;
<p>
Municipalities are a Second layer governance, and are subjected to “state”, and Federal laws of United States. In order to have a better idea of the Island and to further understand the geography that we explored is important to highlight that Puerto Rico has Seventy-eight municipalities with various geographical conditions, from coastal to inland including Culebra and Vieques that are separate Islands. Therefore it is difficult to create a baseline for comparison since they vary not only in territory extension but also have diverse socio-economic conditions. Yet, municipalities as localities, have become important arenas for decision-making, their role has had a pendulum effect during Puerto Rico's planning and management of the urban fabric marking their importance as a study unit.

>"Disasters are sometimes considered external shocks, but disaster risk results from the complex interaction between development processes that generate conditions of exposure, vulnerability and hazard. Disaster risk is therefore considered as the combination of the severity and frequency of a hazard, the numbers of people and assets exposed to the hazard, and their vulnerability to damage."(UNISDR, 2015a)

**MAPPING MUNICIPALITIES AT RISK IN PUERTO RICO & MEASURING VULNERABILITY AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL**

This project develops a decision model based in *social* and *physical* vulnerability metrics that are first mapped individually and secondly added into one final model to render a map showing higher risk for municipalities and possible impact in their capacity to recover in the event of another Hurricane. Disaster risk is expressed as the likelihood of loss of life, injury or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time (UNISDR, 2015.)

**Mapping Social Vulnerability at a Municipal level**

The social vulnerability indicators will be based on demographic and socioeconomic factors, including the change in populations related to migration post Hurricanes.

The Physical vulnerability index will consider environmental conditions and impact in housing stock by using existent and new datasets. The analysis will consider “municipios” as a primary legal division of Puerto Rico. An existent social vulnerability index (SVI) for Puerto Rico developed in 2017 will be revised, but as it is based on census tracts is not transferable to our study. This difference is
relevant because municipios are in charge of implementing and coordinating local government actions being a key player in the provision of services and resilience of communities.

September 20. 6:15 a.m. It is the official time in which hurricane Maria, category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, enters through Yabucoa. This is a southeastern town with ten barrios: Aguacate, Calabaza, Camino Nuevo, Guayabota, Jácana, Juan Marín, Limones, Playa, Pueblo, and Tejas. This area is known for its farmers and agricultural lands-- mostly produces plantains all heavily affected by the storm(3,000 to 4,000 acres of plantains were destroyed.)

>The results of the analysis of Social and Physical vulnerability at a municipal level throughout a combined layer decision model revealed that the municipalities of Yabucoa, Canóvanas, Comerío, Utuado, Juncos and Naguabo are consistenly high scored. This findings suggest that significant condition of risk are in place which requires inmediate attention.
